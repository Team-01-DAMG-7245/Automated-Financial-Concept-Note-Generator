  "original_text": "Use setInequality to set the percentage of WoB as a constraint. The coefficients of the linear\nconstraint should be the WoB percentages associated to each asset, and the right-hand side should be\nthe target portfolio WoB. The convention of the inequality is â‰¤. Since the goal is to maximize portfolio\nWoB, then the target WoB should be a lower bound for the portfolio WoB. Therefore, the signs of the\ncoefficients and the right-hand side of the added inequality should be flipped.",
