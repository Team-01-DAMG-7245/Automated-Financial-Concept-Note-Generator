  "original_text": "To compute the contours of the efficient surface, you add the average ESG score as a constraint using\nthe setInequality function. The coefficients of the linear constraint are the ESG scores associated\nwith each asset and the right-hand side is the target ESG score for the desired contour. Notice that\nthe convention of the inequalities in the Portfolio object is â‰¤. Because the goal is to maximize the\naverage ESG score, the target ESG value for the contour should be a lower bound. Therefore, you\nneed to flip the signs of the coefficients and the right-hand side of the added inequality. The function\nthat computes and plots the contours is in the Local Functions on page 4-282 section.",
