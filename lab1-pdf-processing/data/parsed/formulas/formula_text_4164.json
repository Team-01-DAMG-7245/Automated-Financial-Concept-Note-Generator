  "original_text": "E(r) is the weighed average of r(n),…,r(1). The unnormalized weights are w, w2, …, w(n-1). The\nunnormalized weights do not sum up to 1, so NumEffObs rescales the unnormalized weights. After\nrescaling, the normalized weights (which sum up to 1) are used for averaging. When w = 1, then\nNumEffObs = n, which is the number of observations. When w < 1, NumEffObs is still interpreted as\nthe sample size, but it is less than n due to the down-weight on the observations of the remote past.",
