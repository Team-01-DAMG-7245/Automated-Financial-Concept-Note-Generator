Also, static (non-time-variable) coefficients are simply a special\ncase of the more general dynamic (time-variable) situation, just as a function can be a trivial\nconstant; for example, f(t,Xt) = 4. The SDE in “Equation 14-1” is useful in implementing derived\nclasses that impose additional structure on the drift and diffusion-rate functions.",
