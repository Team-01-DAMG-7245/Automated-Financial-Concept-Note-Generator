This boxchart shows the percent risk contribution of each asset to the total portfolio risk. The
percent risk contribution is computed as

PRC i = xi Σx i
xTΣx

As expected, all the ERC portfolio assets have the same risk contribution to the portfolio. As
discussed after the weights distribution plot, if the problem had other types of constraints, the risk
contribution of the ERC portfolio would not be the same for all assets, but they would have the lowest
variance. Also, the behavior shown in this picture is similar to the behavior shown by the weights
distribution.
