R2023a: fints support removed for Data input argument
Behavior changed in R2023a

fints object support for the Data input argument is removed.

R2018a: Lead and Lag input arguments not supported
Behavior changed in R2018a

The syntax for movavg has changed. There is no longer support for the input arguments Lead and
Lag, only a single windowSize is supported, and there is only one output argument (ma). If you want
to compute the leading and lagging moving averages, you need to run movavg twice and adjust the
windowSize.
