EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days
0 (not in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer [0,1]

End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days, specified as a scalar with a nonnegative
integer 0 or 1, or as an N-by-1 or 1-by-N vector of values 0 or 1.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that rule is not in effect.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that if you are beginning on the last day of a month, and the month has
30 or fewer days, you will end on the last actual day of the future or past month regardless of
whether that month has 28, 29, 30 or 31 days.

Note EndOfMonthRule only applies when you input a date that corresponds to the end of month
as the StartDate. For example, if you enter 02/28/2023 as the StartDate, the
EndOfMonthRule guarantees that the return date matches the last day of the month in the target
output date.

datestr(datemnth('02/28/2023',4,1,0,1))

ans =

'30-Jun-2023'

datemnth returns the target date as the last day of June even though the DayFlag is specified to
return the first day of June.
