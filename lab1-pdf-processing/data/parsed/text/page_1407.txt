gbm

Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model

Description

Creates and displays a geometric Brownian motion model (GBM), which derives from the cev
(constant elasticity of variance) class.

Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) models allow you to simulate sample paths of NVars state
variables driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive
observation periods, approximating continuous-time GBM stochastic processes. Specifically, this
model allows the simulation of vector-valued GBM processes of the form

dXt = μ(t)Xtdt + D(t, Xt)V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
μ is an NVars-by-NVars generalized expected instantaneous rate of return matrix.

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
corresponding element of the state vector Xt.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Creation

Syntax

GBM = gbm(Return,Sigma)
GBM = gbm( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

GBM = gbm(Return,Sigma) creates a default GBM object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.

•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.

Note You can specify combinations of array and function input parameters as needed.
