LastCouponInterest — Compounding convention for computing yield of a bond in last
coupon period
compound (default) | values are simple or compound

Compounding convention for computing the yield of a bond in the last coupon period, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'LastCouponInterest' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-
by-NUMBONDS vector. This is based on only the last coupon and the face value to be repaid. Acceptable
values are:

•
simple

•
compound

Data Types: char | cell

Output Arguments

Yield — Yield to maturity
numeric

Yield to maturity, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

Note By default, when you specify Basis, the SIA bases (0-7) and BUS/252 (base 13) use a
semiannual compounding convention and the ISMA bases (8-12) use an annual compounding
convention.

Price and Yield Conventions

The Price and Yield are related to different formulae for SIA and ICMA conventions.

For SIA conventions, Price and Yield are related by the formula:

Price + Accrued Interest = sum(Cash_Flow*(1+Yield/2)^(-Time))

where the sum is over the bond's cash flows and corresponding times in units of semiannual coupon
periods.

For ICMA conventions, the Price and Yield are related by the formula:

Price + Accrued Interest = sum(Cash_Flow*(1+Yield)^(-Time))

Algorithms

For SIA conventions, the following formula defines bond price and yield:

PV =
CF

(1 + z
