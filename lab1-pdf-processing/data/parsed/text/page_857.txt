Working with One-Way Turnover Constraints Using
PortfolioMAD Object

One-way turnover constraints are optional constraints (see “One-way Turnover Constraints” on page
6-13) that enforce upper bounds on net purchases or net sales. One-way turnover constraints can be
set using the PortfolioMAD object or the setOneWayTurnover function. One-way turnover
constraints depend upon an initial or current portfolio, which is assumed to be zero if not set when
the turnover constraints are set. One-way turnover constraints have properties BuyTurnover, for the
upper bound on net purchases, SellTurnover, for the upper bound on net sales, and InitPort, for
the portfolio against which turnover is computed.

Setting One-Way Turnover Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD
Function

The Properties for the one-way turnover constraints are set using the PortfolioMAD object. Suppose
that you have an initial portfolio with 10 assets in a variable x0 and you want to ensure that turnover
on purchases is no more than 30% and turnover on sales is no more than 20% of the initial portfolio.
To set these turnover constraints:

x0 = [ 0.12; 0.09; 0.08; 0.07; 0.1; 0.1; 0.15; 0.11; 0.08; 0.1 ]; 
p = PortfolioMAD('BuyTurnover', 0.3, 'SellTurnover', 0.2, 'InitPort', x0);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.BuyTurnover)
disp(p.SellTurnover)
disp(p.InitPort)

If the NumAssets or InitPort properties are not set before or when the turnover constraint is set,
various rules are applied to assign default values to these properties (see “Setting Up an Initial or
Current Portfolio” on page 6-33).

Setting Turnover Constraints Using the setOneWayTurnover Function

You can also set properties for portfolio turnover using setOneWayTurnover to specify to the upper
bounds for turnover on purchases (BuyTurnover) and sales (SellTurnover) and an initial portfolio.
Suppose that you have an initial portfolio of 10 assets in a variable x0 and want to ensure that
turnover on purchases is no more than 30% and that turnover on sales is no more than 20% of the
initial portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use setOneWayTurnover to set the turnover
constraints with and without the initial portfolio being set previously:
