N — Dependent random counting process for generating number of jumps
random numbers from Poisson distribution with parameter JumpFreq from a bates object (default) |
three-dimensional array | function

Dependent random counting process for generating the number of jumps, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'N' and a function or an (NPeriods ⨉ NSteps) -by-NJumps-by-NTrials
three-dimensional array of dependent random variates. If you specify a function, N must return an
NJumps-by-1 column vector, and you must call it with two inputs: a real-valued scalar observation
time t followed by an NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Note The N name-value pair argument is supported only when you use a bates object for the MDL
input argument.

StorePaths — Flag that indicates how Paths is stored and returned
true (default) | logical with values true or false

Flag that indicates how the output array Paths is stored and returned, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'StorePaths' and a scalar numeric or logical 1 (true) or 0 (false).

If StorePaths is true (the default value) or is unspecified, simByQuadExp returns Paths as a
three-dimensional time-series array.

If StorePaths is false (logical 0), simByQuadExp returns Paths as an empty matrix.

Data Types: logical

Processes — Sequence of end-of-period processes or state vector adjustments
simByQuadExp makes no adjustments and performs no processing (default) | function | cell array of
functions

Sequence of end-of-period processes or state vector adjustments, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'Processes' and a function or cell array of functions of the form

Xt = P(t, Xt)

The simByQuadExp function runs processing functions at each interpolation time. The functions
must accept the current interpolation time t, and the current state vector Xt and return a state vector
that can be an adjustment to the input state.

If you specify more than one processing function, simByQuadExp invokes the functions in the order
in which they appear in the cell array. You can use this argument to specify boundary conditions,
prevent negative prices, accumulate statistics, plot graphs, and more.

The end-of-period Processes argument allows you to terminate a given trial early. At the end of each
time step, simByQuadExp tests the state vector Xt for an all-NaN condition. Thus, to signal an early
termination of a given trial, all elements of the state vector Xt must be NaN. This test enables you to
