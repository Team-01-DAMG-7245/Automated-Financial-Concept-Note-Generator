If user-controlled cash assets are specified (that is, CashAssets or DebtAssets parameters for
runBacktest are set), then expenses are paid using the first specified cash asset if it has
sufficient funds. If not, the first cash asset is set to $0 and the engine moves on to the second
cash asset, continuing in this way until the expense is paid. Once all CashAssets are exhausted
and if some expense remains unpaid, then the first specified DebtAsset incurs all remaining
expenses. If no DebtAsset is specified, then the final cash asset goes negative to pay any
remaining expense.
