Input Arguments

x0 — Increasing ages for raw data
vector of nonnegative integer values

Increasing ages for raw data, specified as nonnegative integer values in an N0 vector.

The vector of ages x must contain nonnegative integer values. If the input series is the discrete
survival function lx, then the starting age need only be nonnegative. Otherwise, the starting age
must be 0.

Data Types: double

lx0 — Collection of num standardized survivor series
matrix

Collection of num standardized survivor series, specified as an N0-by-num matrix. The input lx0 series
is the number of people alive at age x, given 100,000 alive at birth. Values of 0 or NaN in the input
table lx0 are ignored.

Data Types: double

y0 — Collection of num life table series to be converted
matrix

Collection of num life table series to be converted, specified as an N0-by-num matrix. The default y0
series is lx0.

Data Types: double

y0type — Type of mortality series for input y0 with default 'lx'
'lx' (default) | character vector with values 'qx', 'lx', 'dx'
