Single Bond Example

As an example, suppose that you have a bond with these characteristics:

Settle          = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity        = '15-Oct-2007'
Period          = 2
Basis           = 0
EndMonthRule    = 1
IssueDate       = NaN
FirstCouponDate = NaN
LastCouponDate  = NaN

Period, Basis, and EndMonthRule are set to their default values, and IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are set to NaN.

Formally, a NaN is an IEEE® arithmetic standard for Not-a-Number and is used to indicate the result
of an undefined operation (for example, zero divided by zero). However, NaN is also a convenient
placeholder. In the SIA functions of Financial Toolbox software, NaN indicates the presence of a
nonapplicable value. It tells the Financial Toolbox functions to ignore the input value and apply the
default. Setting IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate to NaN in this example tells
cfdates to assume that the bond has been issued before settlement and that no odd first or last
coupon periods exist.

Having set these values, all these calls to cfdates produce the same result.

cfdates(Settle, Maturity)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [])
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, [], Basis)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, [], [])
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [], EndMonthRule)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [], NaN)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [], [], IssueDate)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [], [], IssueDate, [], [])
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, [], [], [], [],LastCouponDate)
cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis, EndMonthRule, ... 
IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate)

Thus, leaving a particular input unspecified has the same effect as passing an empty matrix ([]) or
passing a NaN – all three tell cfdates (and other Financial Toolbox functions) to use the default value
for a particular input parameter.

Bond Portfolio Example

Since the previous example included only a single bond, there was no difference between passing an
empty matrix or passing a NaN for an optional input argument. For a portfolio of bonds, however,
using NaN as a placeholder is the only way to specify default acceptance for some bonds while
explicitly setting nondefault values for the remaining bonds in the portfolio.

Now suppose that you have a portfolio of two bonds.

Settle   = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity = ['15-Oct-2007'; '15-Oct-2010']

These calls to cfdates all set the coupon period to its default value (Period = 2) for both bonds.
