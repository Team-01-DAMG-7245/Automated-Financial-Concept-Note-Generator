Calculate Market Invariants

For market invariants, use the standard: daily changes in yield to maturity for each series. You can
estimate their statistical distribution to be multivariate normal. IID analysis on each invariant series
produces decent results - more so in the "independent" factor than "identical". A more thorough
modeling using more complex distributions and/or time series models is beyond the scope of this
example. What will need to be accounted for is the estimation of distribution parameters in the
presence of missing data. The 30 year bonds were discontinued for a period between Feb 2002 and
Feb 2006, so there are no yields for this time period.

% Invariants are assumed to be daily changes in YTM rates.
tsYTMRateDeltas = diff(tsYTMRates);

About 1/3 of the 30 year rates (column 9) are missing from the original data set. Rather than throw
out all these observations, an expectation maximization routine ecmnmle is used to estimate the
mean and covariance of the invariants. The default option (NaN skip for initial estimates) is used.

[tsInvMu,tsInvCov] = ecmnmle(tsYTMRateDeltas);

Calculate standard deviations and correlations using cov2corr.

[tsInvStd,tsInvCorr] = cov2corr(tsInvCov);

The investment horizon is 1 month (21 business days between 9/1/2010 and 10/1/2010). Since the
invariants are summable and the means and variances of normal distributions are normal, you can
project the invariants to the investment horizon as follows:
