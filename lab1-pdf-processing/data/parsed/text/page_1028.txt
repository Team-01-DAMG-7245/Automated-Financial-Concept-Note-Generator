Maturity4 = datenum('20-Sep-13');
Spread4Run = 550;
ProbData4Run = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,[Maturity4 Spread4Run],Settle);
Spread4Std = 500;
Price4 = cdsprice(ZeroData,ProbData4Run,Settle,Maturity4,Spread4Std);
Upfront4 = Price4/10000000;
fprintf('A running spread of %5.2f is equivalent to\n',Spread4Run);

A running spread of 550.00 is equivalent to

fprintf('   a standard spread of %5.2f with an upfront of %8.7f\n', ...
   Spread4Std,Upfront4);

a standard spread of 500.00 with an upfront of 0.0167576

To reverse the conversion:

ProbData4Upf = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,[Maturity4 Upfront4 Spread4Std],Settle);
Spread4RunFromUpf = cdsspread(ZeroData,ProbData4Upf,Settle,Maturity4);
fprintf('A standard spread of %5.2f with an upfront of %8.7f\n', ...
   Spread4Std,Upfront4);

A standard spread of 500.00 with an upfront of 0.0167576

fprintf('    is equivalent to a running spread of %5.2f\n',Spread4RunFromUpf);

is equivalent to a running spread of 550.00

As discussed in Beumee et. al., 2009 (see “Credit Derivatives” on page A-5), the FHR approach is a
quoting convention only, and leads to quotes inconsistent with market data. For example, calculating
the upfront for the three-year (standard dates) CDS contract with a standard spread of 100 bp using
the FHR approach and comparing the results to the upfront amounts previously calculated,
demonstrates that the FHR-based approach yields a different upfront amount.

Maturity5 = MarketData(3,1);
Spread5Run = MarketData(3,2);
ProbData5Run = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,[Maturity5 Spread5Run],Settle);
Spread5Std = 100;
Price5 = cdsprice(ZeroData,ProbData5Run,Settle,Maturity5,Spread5Std);
Upfront5 = Price5/10000000;
fprintf('Relative error of FHR-based upfront amount: %3.1f%%\n', ...
   ((Upfront5-Upfront3(3))/Upfront3(3))*100);

Relative error of FHR-based upfront amount: -0.8%
