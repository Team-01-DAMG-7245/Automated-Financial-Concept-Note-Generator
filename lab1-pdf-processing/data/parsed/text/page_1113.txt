Compute Prices, and Delta, Gamma, and Vega Sensitivity

Based on the Black-Scholes model, compute the prices, and the delta, gamma, and vega sensitivity
greeks of each of the four options. The functions blsprice and blsdelta have two outputs, while
blsgamma and blsvega have only one. The price and delta of a call option differ from the price and
delta of an otherwise equivalent put option, in contrast to the gamma and vega sensitivities, which
are valid for both calls and puts.

[CallPrices, PutPrices] = blsprice(StockPrice, StrikePrice, ... 
RiskFreeRate, ExpiryTime, Volatility, DividendRate);

[CallDeltas, PutDeltas] = blsdelta(StockPrice, ... 
StrikePrice, RiskFreeRate, ExpiryTime, Volatility, ... 
DividendRate);

Gammas = blsgamma(StockPrice, StrikePrice, RiskFreeRate, ...
                  ExpiryTime, Volatility , DividendRate)'

Gammas = 1×4

0.0290    0.0353    0.0548    0.0074

Vegas  = blsvega(StockPrice, StrikePrice, RiskFreeRate, ...
                 ExpiryTime, Volatility , DividendRate)'

Vegas = 1×4

17.4293   20.0347    9.5837   83.5225

Extract the prices and deltas of interest to account for the distinction between call and puts.

Prices = [CallPrices(1) PutPrices(2) CallPrices(3)... 
PutPrices(4)]

Prices = 1×4

6.3441    6.6035    4.2993   22.7694

Deltas = [CallDeltas(1) PutDeltas(2) CallDeltas(3)... 
PutDeltas(4)]

Deltas = 1×4

0.5856   -0.6255    0.7003   -0.4830

Solve Linear System of Equations for Option Portfolio

Assuming an arbitrary portfolio value of $17,000, set up and solve the linear system of equations such
that the overall option portfolio is simultaneously delta, gamma, and vega-neutral. The solution
computes the value of a particular greek of a portfolio of options as a weighted average of the
