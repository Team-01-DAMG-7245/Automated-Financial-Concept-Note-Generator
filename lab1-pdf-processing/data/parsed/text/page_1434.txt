This technique attempts to reduce variance by inducing negative dependence between paired input
samples, ideally resulting in negative dependence between paired output samples. The greater the
extent of negative dependence, the more effective antithetic sampling is.

Algorithms

The simBySolution method simulates NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state variables,
driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods,
approximating continuous-time Hull-White/Vasicek (HWV) by an approximation of the closed-form
solution.

Consider a separable, vector-valued HWV model of the form:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + V(t)dWt

where:

•
X is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean reversion speeds (the rate of mean reversion).

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels (long-run mean or level).

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
W is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

The simBySolution method simulates the state vector Xt using an approximation of the closed-form
solution of diagonal-drift models.

When evaluating the expressions, simBySolution assumes that all model parameters are piecewise-
constant over each simulation period.

In general, this is not the exact solution to the models, because the probability distributions of the
simulated and true state vectors are identical only for piecewise-constant parameters.

When parameters are piecewise-constant over each observation period, the simulated process is
exact for the observation times at which Xt is sampled.

Gaussian diffusion models, such as hwv, allow negative states. By default, simBySolution does
nothing to prevent negative states, nor does it guarantee that the model be strictly mean-reverting.
Thus, the model may exhibit erratic or explosive growth.
