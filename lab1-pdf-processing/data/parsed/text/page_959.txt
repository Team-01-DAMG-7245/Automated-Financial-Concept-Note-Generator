Shifting the critical values to the right or left changes the transition probabilities. For example, here
is the transition matrix obtained by shifting the TTC thresholds by 0.5 to the right. Note that default
probabilities increase.

shiftedThresholds = thresholdMat+0.5;
Example_DisplayTransitions(transprobfromthresholds(shiftedThresholds), ...
   [],{'AAA','AA','A','BBB','BB','B','CCC'}, ...
   {'AAA','AA','A','BBB','BB','B','CCC','D','NR'})

Given a particular PIT matrix, the idea in [6 on page 8-43] and [8 on page 8-43] is to vary the
shifting parameter applied to the TTC thresholds so that the resulting transition matrix is as close as
possible to the PIT matrix. Closeness is measured as the sum of squares of differences between
corresponding transition probabilities. The optimal shifting value is called credit index. A credit index
is determined for every PIT transition matrix in the sample.

You can use fminunc from Optimization Toolboxâ„¢ to find the credit indices.

CreditIndex = zeros(nYears,1);
ExitFlag = zeros(nYears,1);
options = optimset('LargeScale','Off','Display','Off');
for i=1:nYears
   errorfun = @(z)norm(squeeze(TransMat(:,:,i))-...
      transprobfromthresholds(...
      transprobtothresholds(tmTTC)+z),'fro');
