•
If the set is nonempty and unbounded, isbounded = false.

•
If the set is nonempty and bounded, isbounded = true.

•
If the set is empty, glb and gub are set to NaN vectors.

An isbounded value is returned for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD input object
(obj).

Upper and Lower Bounds

Upper and lower bounds in portfolio optimization are critical constraints that help define the limits of
asset allocation, ensuring that the resulting portfolio aligns with the investor's goals for risk
tolerance.

Tips

•
You can also use dot notation to estimate the global lower and upper bounds for a given set of
portfolios.

[glb, gub, isbounded] = obj.estimateBounds;

•
Estimated bounds are accurate in most cases to within 1.0e-8. If you intend to use these bounds
directly in a portfolio object, ensure that if you impose such bound constraints, a lower bound of 0
is probably preferable to a lower bound of, for example, 1.0e-10 for portfolio weights.
