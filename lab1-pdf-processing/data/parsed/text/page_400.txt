Optimize the Asset Allocation Directly Against Factors with a Problem-Based Definition
Framework

For the factors, you can use statistical factors extracted from the asset return series. In this example,
you use principal component analysis (PCA) to extract statistical factors [1 on page 4-236]. You can
then use this factor model to solve the portfolio optimization problem.

With a factor model, p asset returns can be expressed as a linear combination of k factor returns,
ra = μa + F rf + εa , where k<<p. In the mean-variance framework, portfolio risk is

Var Rp = Var raTwa = Var μa + F rf + εa

Twa = waT FΣfFT + D wa = wf
T Σf wf + waT D wa, with

wf = FTwa,

where:

Rp is the portfolio return (a scalar).

ra is the asset return.

μa  is the mean of asset return.

F is the factor loading, with the dimensions p-by-k.

rf is the factor return.

εa is the idiosyncratic return related to each asset.

wa is the asset weight.

wf is the factor weight.
