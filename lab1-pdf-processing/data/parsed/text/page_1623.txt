This model usually corresponds to a price process whose volatility (variance rate) is governed by
the second univariate model.

•
The other model is a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (cir) square root diffusion model.

dX2t = S(t)[L(t) −X2t]dt + V(t) X2tdW2t

This model describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled Bates price process.

This simulation engine provides a discrete-time approximation of the underlying generalized
continuous-time process. The simulation is derived directly from the stochastic differential equation
of motion. Thus, the discrete-time process approaches the true continuous-time process only as
DeltaTime approaches zero.
