Introduction

Financial Toolbox software provides the following suite of functions for computing price and yield on
Treasury bills.

Treasury Bill Functions

Function
Purpose

tbilldisc2yield
Convert discount rate to yield.

tbillprice
Price Treasury bill given its yield or discount rate.

tbillrepo
Break-even discount of repurchase agreement.

tbillyield
Yield and discount of Treasury bill given its price.

tbillyield2disc
Convert yield to discount rate.

tbillval01
The value of 1 basis point (one hundredth of one percentage point,
or 0.0001) given the characteristics of the Treasury bill, as
represented by its settlement and maturity dates. You can relate
the basis point to discount, money-market, or bond-equivalent
yield.

For all functions with yield in the computation, you can specify yield as money-market or bond-
equivalent yield. The functions all assume a face value of $100 for each Treasury bill.

Treasury Bill Repurchase Agreements

This example shows how to compute the break-even discount rate. This is the rate that correctly
prices the Treasury bill such that the profit from selling the tail equals 0.

Maturity = '26-Dec-2002';
InitialDiscount = 0.0161;
PurchaseDate = '26-Sep-2002';
SaleDate = '26-Oct-2002';
RepoRate = 0.0149;

BreakevenDiscount = tbillrepo(RepoRate, InitialDiscount, ... 
PurchaseDate, SaleDate, Maturity)

BreakevenDiscount = 
0.0167

You can check the result of this computation by examining the cash flows in and out from the
repurchase transaction. First compute the price of the Treasury bill on the purchase date (September
26).
