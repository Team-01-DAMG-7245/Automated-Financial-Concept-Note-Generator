Use simulate to simulate the end-of-year stock prices using the GBM model (gbm) over nTrials
trials.

% Simulate stock prices at maturity
[Paths, ~, ~] = simulate(gbmobj,nPeriods,'nTrials',nTrials,'DeltaTime',T);

% Extract the final prices for all trials
ST = Paths(end, :, 1);

Calculate the payoff for European call and put options based on the simulated prices.

% Calculate payoffs for call and put options
callPayoff = max(ST - K, 0)

callPayoff = 
5.7533

putPayoff = max(K - ST, 0)

putPayoff = 
0

Discount these payoffs back to the present value and then average the payoff values to estimate the
option prices.

% Discount payoffs back to present value and average
callPrice = exp(-r * T) * mean(callPayoff)

callPrice = 
5.4727

putPrice = exp(-r * T) * mean(putPayoff)

putPrice = 
0

Display the estimated prices for both the call and put options.

% Display results
fprintf('European Call Option Price: %.4f\n', callPrice);

European Call Option Price: 5.4727

fprintf('European Put Option Price: %.4f\n', putPrice);

European Put Option Price: 0.0000
