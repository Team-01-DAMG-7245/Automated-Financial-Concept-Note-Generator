Calculate Portfolio Weights For a Target Risk Level

The Portfolio object is able to find an efficient portfolio with respect to a specified target risk.

Load Portfolio

Load a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix for 30 stocks.

load StockStats

Create Portfolio Object with Default Constraints

The default constraints for a Portfolio object are that it is a long-only portfolio and that it is 100%
invested. Many other constraint types are possible.

P = Portfolio('mean',expRet,'covar',expCov);
P = setDefaultConstraints(P);

Plot Full Efficient Frontier

Use the plotFrontier function with the Portfolio object to visualize the full frontier. Other
functions exist that allow you to probe into particular portfolios along the frontier.

P.plotFrontier

Capture Upper and Lower Bounds of Portfolio Risks and Returns

It is useful to know what are the upper and lower limits of the portfolio moments along the efficient
frontier. This information allows you to determine what are feasible targets. Use the
estimateFrontierLimits function with the Portfolio object to identify the weights at these
extremes. Then you can use the estimatePortMoments function Portfolio object to find the
limiting moments.
