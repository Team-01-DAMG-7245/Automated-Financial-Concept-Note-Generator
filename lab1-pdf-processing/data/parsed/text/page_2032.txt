Data Types: double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer 0 or 1

End-of-month rule flag, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'EndMonthRule' and a
scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector. This rule applies only when Maturity is an
end-of-month date for a month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the same numerical day of
the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the last actual day of the
month.

Data Types: logical

IssueDate — Bond issue date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Bond Issue date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'IssueDate' and a scalar or a
NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors.

If you do not specify an IssueDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cftimes also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Irregular or normal first coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'FirstCouponDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime
array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, cftimes also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Irregular or normal last coupon date
