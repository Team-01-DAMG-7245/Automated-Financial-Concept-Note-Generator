The default is to ignore this constraint.

Note The average turnover constraint (see “Average Turnover Constraints” on page 5-13) with τ is
not a combination of the one-way turnover constraints with τ = τB = τS.

Cardinality Constraints

Cardinality constraint limits the number of assets in the optimal allocation for an PortfolioCVaR
object. Use setMinMaxNumAssets to specify the 'MinNumAssets' and 'MaxNumAssets'
constraints. To mathematically formulate this type of constraints, a binary variable vi is needed. vi = 0
indicates that asset i is not selected and vi = 1 indicates that the asset was selected. Thus

MinNumAssets ≤
∑
i = 1

NumAssets
vi ≤MaxNumAssets

The default is to ignore this constraint.
