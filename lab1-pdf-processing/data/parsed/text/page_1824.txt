ZeroBasis — Basis of the zero curve
0 (actual/actual) (default) | integer with value of 0 to 13

Basis of the zero curve, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ZeroBasis' and the
same values listed for Basis.

Data Types: double

RecoveryMethod — Recovery method
'facevalue' (default) | character vector with value of 'presentvalue' or 'facevalue' | string
object with value of 'presentvalue' or 'facevalue'

Recovery method, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RecoveryMethod' and a
character vector or a string with a value of 'presentvalue' or 'facevalue'.

•
'presentvalue' assumes that upon default, a bond is valued at a given fraction to the
hypothetical present value of its remaining cash flows, discounted at risk-free rate.

•
'facevalue' assumes that a bond recovers a given fraction of its face value upon recovery.

Data Types: char | string

Face — Face or par value
100 (default) | numeric

Face or par value, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Face' and a NINST-by-1
vector of bonds.

Data Types: double

Period — Payment frequency
2 (default) | numeric with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12

Payment frequency, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Period' and a N-by-1
vector with values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.

Data Types: double

Basis — Day-count basis of the instrument
0 (actual/actual) (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Day-count basis of the instrument, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Basis' and
a positive integer using a NINST-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)
