Input Arguments

historical — Historical dates and data
matrix | cell array | table | timetable

Historical dates and data, specified as an N-by-2 matrix, cell array, table, or timetable where the first
column is the date, and the second column is the data associated for that date. N indicates the
number of dates. By using the cell array format for the input, you can make the first column datetime
and produce the same plot as would serial date numbers or date character vectors. For example:

historical(:,1) = num2cell(datetime(2006:2010,1,1));
forecast(:,1) = num2cell(datetime(2011:2015,1,1));
fanplot (historical, forecast);

Data Types: cell | double | table | timetable

forecast — Forecast dates and data
matrix | cell array of character vectors | table | timetable

Forecast dates and data, specified as an N-by-M matrix, cell array, table, or timetable where the first
column is the date, and the second to the last columns are the data observations. N indicates the
number of the dates and (M – 1) is the number for data observations. By using the cell array format
for the input, you can make the first column datetime and produce the same plot as would serial date
numbers or date character vectors. For example:

historical(:,1) = num2cell(datetime(2006:2010,1,1));
forecast(:,1) = num2cell(datetime(2011:2015,1,1));
fanplot (historical, forecast);

Data Types: cell | double | table | timetable
