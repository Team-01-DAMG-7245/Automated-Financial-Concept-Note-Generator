SDE Simulation and Interpolation Methods

The sde class provides default simulation and interpolation methods for all derived classes:

•
simulate: High-level wrapper around the user-specified simulation method stored in the
Simulation property

•
simByEuler: Default Euler approximation simulation method

•
interpolate: Stochastic interpolation method (that is, Brownian bridge)

You can use the simBySolution function to simulate approximate solutions of diagonal-drift
processes for the following classes:

•
gbm supports simBySolution

•
hwv supports simBySolution

•
merton supports simBySolution

You can use the simBySolution function with the name-value arguments for MonteCarloMethod
and QuasiSequence to simulates approximate solutions of quasi-Monte Carlo simulations for the
following classes:

•
gbm supports simBySolution

•
hwv supports simBySolution

•
merton supports simBySolution

In addition, you can also use:

•
simByTransition with a cir object to approximates a continuous-time Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)
model by an approximation of the transition density function.

•
simByTransition with a bates object to approximates a continuous-time Bates model by an
approximation of the transition density function.

•
simByTransition with a heston object to approximates a continuous-time Heston model by an
approximation of the transition density function.

•
simByQuadExp with a heston, bates, or cir object to generate sample paths by using a
Quadratic-Exponential discretization scheme.

•
simByMilstein with a heston, bates, cir, sde, or merton object to process sample paths by
Milstein approximation.

•
simByMilstein2 with a heston, bates, cir, sde, or merton object to process sample paths by
second order Milstein approximation.

•
simByHybrid with a rvm or roughbergomi object to process sample paths by hybrid
approximation.

•
simByEuler with a rvm, roughheston, or roughbergomi object to process sample paths by
Euler approximation.
