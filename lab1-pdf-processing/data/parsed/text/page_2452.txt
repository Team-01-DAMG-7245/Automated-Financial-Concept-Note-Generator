(Optional) Type of mortality series for input y0, specified as a character vector with one of the
following values:

•
'qx' — Input is a table of discrete hazards (qx).

•
'lx' — Input is a table of discrete survival counts (lx).

•
'dx' — Input is a table of discrete decrements (dx).

Whereas the output series have forced termination, the input series (y0) can have one of several
types of termination:

•
Natural termination runs out to the last person so that lx goes to 0, qx goes to 1, and dx goes to
0. For more information, see “Natural Termination” on page 15-1147.

•
Truncated termination stops at a terminal age so that lx is positive, qx is less than 1, and dx is
positive. Any ages after the terminal age are NaN values. For more information, see “Truncated
Termination” on page 15-1148.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

qx — Discrete hazard function
matrix

Discrete hazard function, returned as an N0-by-num matrix with forced termination. For more
information, see “Forced Termination” on page 15-1147.

The series qx is the conditional probability that a person at age x will die between age x and the next
age in the series.

lx — Discrete survival function
matrix

Discrete survival function, returned as an N0-by-num matrix with forced termination. For more
information, see “Forced Termination” on page 15-1147.

The series lx is the number of people alive at age x, given 100,000 alive at birth.

dx — Discrete decrements function
matrix

Discrete decrements function, returned as an N0-by-num matrix with forced termination. For more
information, see “Forced Termination” on page 15-1147.

The series dx is the number of people who die out of 100,000 alive at birth, between age x and the
next age in the series.
