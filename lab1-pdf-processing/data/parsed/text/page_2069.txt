cpndatepq

Previous quasi-coupon date for fixed-income security

Syntax

PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq(Settle,Maturity)
PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate)

Description

PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq(Settle,Maturity) determines the previous quasi-
coupon date for a set of NUMBONDS fixed income securities. Prior quasi-coupon dates determine the
length of the standard coupon period for the fixed income security of interest, and do not necessarily
coincide with actual coupon payment dates. This function finds the previous quasi-coupon date for
bonds with a coupon structure whose first or last period is either normal, short, or long.

Required input arguments must be number of bonds, NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS, conforming
vectors or scalars.

PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate), using optional input arguments, determines the previous
quasi-coupon date for a set of NUMBONDS fixed income securities.

Optional input arguments must be either NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS conforming vectors,
scalars, or empty matrices.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then PreviousQuasiCouponDate is returned as a serial
date number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime
arrays.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then PreviousQuasiCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.

Examples

Determine the Previous Quasi Coupon Date for a Portfolio of Fixed-Income Securities

Given a pair of bonds with the following characteristics:

Settle = [datetime(1997,5,30) ; datetime(1997,12,10)]; 
Maturity = [datetime(2002,11,30) ; datetime(2004,6,10)];

With no FirstCouponDate explicitly supplied, compute the PreviousCouponDate for this pair of
bonds.

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(Settle, Maturity)
