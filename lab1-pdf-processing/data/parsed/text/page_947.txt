CPF: Corporate profits forecast

SPR: Corporate spread over treasuries

This is the same model as in [6 on page 8-43], except the model in [6 on page 8-43] is for IG only.

As previously discussed, age is known to be an important factor regarding default rates. The
corporate profits provide information on the economic environment. The corporate spread is a proxy
for credit quality. Age, environment, and quality are three dimensions frequently found in credit
analysis models.

inSample = 4:nYears-1;
T = length(inSample);
varNames = {'AGE','CPF','SPR'};
X = [AGE CPF SPR];
X = X(inSample,:);
y = DefRate(inSample+1); % DefaultRate, year t+1
stats = regstats(y,X);

fprintf('\nConst   AGE   CPF   SPR   adjR^2\n')

Const   AGE   CPF   SPR   adjR^2

fprintf('%1.2f  %1.2f %1.2f  %1.2f   %1.4f\n',...
   [stats.beta;stats.adjrsquare])

-1.19  0.15 -0.10  0.71   0.7424

The coefficients have the expected sign: default rates tend to increase with a higher proportion of 3-
year issuers, decrease with good corporate profits, and increase when the corporate yields are
higher. The adjusted R square shows a good fit.

The in-sample fit, or how close the model predictions are from the sample points used to fit the
model, is shown in the following figure.

bHat = stats.beta;
yHat = [ones(T,1),X]*bHat;
