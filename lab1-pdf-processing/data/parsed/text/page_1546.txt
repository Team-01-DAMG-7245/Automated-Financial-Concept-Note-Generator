Performance fee charged as a percent of the total portfolio growth, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'PerformanceFee' and a numeric scalar. The performance fee, sometimes called
an incentive fee, is a fee paid to reward a fund manager based on performance of the fund. The fee is
paid periodically based on the schedule specified by the PerformanceFeeSchedule. The default is
0, meaning no performance fee is paid.

For more information, see “Performance Fees” on page 15-260.

PerformanceHurdle — Annualized hurdle rate or column in assets or signals to act as
hurdle asset
0 (default) | decimal | string

Annualized hurdle rate or column in assetPrices or signalData to act as hurdle asset, specified
as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'PerformanceHurdle' and a numeric scalar or a string.
The PerformanceHurdle sets a minimum level of performance that a strategy must achieve before
the performance fee is paid.

•
If specified as a numeric scalar, the hurdle represents an annualized growth rate, for example 0.05
indicates a 5% growth rate. In this case, the performance fee is only paid if, on a performance fee
date, the strategy portfolio value is greater than the high-water mark and the portfolio has
produced a return greater than 5% annualized since the start of the backtest. The fee is paid only
on the growth in excess of both the hurdle rate and the previous high-water mark.

•
If specified as a string, the hurdle must match a column in either the assetPrices or
signalData timetables of the backtest and it indicates a hurdle asset. In this case, the
performance fee is paid only if the portfolio value is greater than the high-water mark and the
portfolio has produced a return greater than the hurdle asset return since the start of the
backtest. The performance fee is charged only on the portfolio growth in excess of both the hurdle
asset growth and the previous high-water mark.

Data Types: double | string

PerformanceFeeSchedule — Performance fee schedule
calyears(1) (default) | integer | vector of datetimes | duration object | calendarDuration
object

Performance fee schedule, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'PerformanceFeeSchedule' and a numeric scalar, a duration or calendarDuration object, or
alternatively as a vector of datetimes.

PerformanceFeeSchedule specifies the schedule of dates where the performance fee is charged (if
PerformanceFee is defined). The default is calyears(1), meaning the performance fee is charged
annually.

For more information, see “Defining Schedules for Backtest Strategies” on page 15-258.

Data Types: double | datetime | object

UserData — Strategy-specific user data for use in rebalanceFcn
[] (default) | struct

Strategy-specific user data for use in rebalanceFcn, specified as a struct. When UserData is set to
a struct, the backtestEngine provides all user-defined rebalanceFcn function handle functions
