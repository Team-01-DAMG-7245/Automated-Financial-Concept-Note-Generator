estimateBounds

Estimate global lower and upper bounds for set of portfolios

Syntax

[glb,gub,isbounded] = estimateBounds(obj)
[glb,gub,isbounded] = estimateBounds(obj,obtainExactBounds)

Description

[glb,gub,isbounded] = estimateBounds(obj) estimates global lower and upper bounds for
set of portfolios for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD objects. For details on the
respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object Workflow” on page 4-
18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object Workflow” on page 6-
16.

Note The estimateBounds function does not consider cardinality or semicontinuous constraints.
For more information, see “Working with 'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets, and
MaxNumAssets Constraints Using Portfolio Objects” on page 4-81.

[glb,gub,isbounded] = estimateBounds(obj,obtainExactBounds) estimates global lower
and upper bounds for set of portfolios with an additional option specified for obtainExactBounds.

Examples

Create an Unbounded Portfolio for a Portfolio Object

Create an unbounded portfolio set.

p = Portfolio('AInequality', [1 -1; 1 1 ], 'bInequality', 0);
[lb, ub, isbounded] = estimateBounds(p)

lb = 2×1
