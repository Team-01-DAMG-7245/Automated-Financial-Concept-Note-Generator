The first rebalance date comes on February 8 but the strategy does not have enough price history to
fill out a valid lookback window (minimum is 30 days), so no rebalance occurs. The next rebalance
date is on March 16, a full 50 days into the backtest.

This situation is not ideal as these 50 days sitting in an all-cash position represent approximately 20%
of the total backtest. Consequently, when the backtesting engine reports on the performance of the
strategy (that is, the total return, Sharpe ratio, volatility, and so on), the results do not reflect the
"true" strategy performance because the strategy only began to make asset allocation decisions only
about 20% into the backtest.

Warm Start Backtest

It is possible to "warm start" the backtest. A warm start means that the backtest results reflect the
strategy performance in the market conditions reflected in the price timetable. To start, set the initial
weights of the strategy to avoid starting all in cash.

The inverse variance strategy requires 30 days of price history to fill out a valid lookback window, so
you can partition the price data set into two sections, a "warm-up" set and a "test" set.

warmupRange = 1:30;
% The 30th row is included in both ranges since the day 30 price is used
% to compute the day 31 returns.
testRange = 30:height(pricesTT);

Use the warm-up partition to set the initial weights of the inverse variance strategy. By doing so, you
can begin the backtest with the strategy already "running" and avoid the initial weeks spent in the
cash position.

% Use the rebalance function to set the initial weights. This might
% or might not be possible for other strategies depending on the details of
% the strategy logic.
initWeights = inverseVarianceFcn([],pricesTT(warmupRange,:));

Update the strategy and rerun the backtest. Since the warm-up range is used to initialize the inverse
variance strategy, you must omit this data from the backtest to avoid a look-ahead bias, or "seeing the
future," and to backtest only over the "test range."

% Set the initial weights on the strategy in the backtester. You can do this when you 
% create the strategy as well, using the 'InitialWeights' parameter.
backtester.Strategies(1).InitialWeights = initWeights;

% Rerun the backtest over the "test" range.
backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT(testRange,:));

When you generate the area plot, you can see that the issue where the strategy is in cash for the first
portion of the backtest is avoided.
