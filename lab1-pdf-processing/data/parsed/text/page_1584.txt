runBacktest

Run backtest on one or more strategies

Syntax

backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT)
backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT,signalTT)
backtester = runBacktest( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT) runs the backtest over the timetable of
adjusted asset price data.

runBacktest initializes each strategy previously defined using backtestStrategy to the
InitialPortfolioValue and then begins processing the timetable of price data (pricesTT) as
follows:

1
At each time step, the runBacktest function applies the asset returns to the strategy portfolio
positions.

2
The runBacktest function determines which strategies to rebalance based on the
RebalanceFrequency property of the backtestStrategy objects.

3
For strategies that need rebalancing, the runBacktest function calls their rebalance functions
with a rolling window of asset price data based on the LookbackWindow property of each
backtestStrategy.

4
Transaction costs are calculated and charged based on the changes in asset positions and the
TransactionCosts property of each backtestStrategy object.

5
After the backtest is complete, the results are stored in several properties of the
backtestEngine object. For more information, see “runBacktest Processing Steps” on page 15-
291.

backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT,signalTT) run the backtest using the
adjusted asset price data and signal data. When you specify the signal data timetable (signalTT),
then the runBacktest function runs the backtest and additionally passes a rolling window of signal
data to the rebalance function of each strategy during the rebalance step.

backtester = runBacktest( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more optional
name-value pair arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax. For example,
backtester = runBacktest(backtester,assetPrices,'Start',50,'End',100).
