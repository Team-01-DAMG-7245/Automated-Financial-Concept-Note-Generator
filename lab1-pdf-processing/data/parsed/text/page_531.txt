Choose Single Portfolio Using GBWM

GBWM provides a way to choose a single portfolio on the efficient frontier that allows you to
incorporate the investor's preference in a straightforward way. In this case, the investor's goal is to
reach a target wealth G from their initial wealth W0 at the end of the investment period T. Therefore,
you can formulate the problem as choosing the portfolio that maximizes the probability of having a
wealth at time T that surpasses the goal G, while making sure that the chosen weights are on the
efficient frontier.

For this example, assume that the wealth evolves following a Brownian motion [1 on page 4-366]
