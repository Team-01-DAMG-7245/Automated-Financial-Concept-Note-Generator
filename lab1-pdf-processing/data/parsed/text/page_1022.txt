Finding Breakeven Spread for New CDS Contract

This example shows how to compute the breakeven, or running, spread. The breakeven spread is the
premium a protection buyer must pay, with no upfront payments, to receive protection for credit
events.

Spreads are expressed in basis points (bp). There is a notional amount associated to the CDS contract
to determine the monetary amounts of the premium payments.

New quotes for CDS contracts can be obtained with cdsspread. After obtaining a default probability
curve using cdsbootstrap, you get quotes that are consistent with current market conditions.

In this example, instead of standard CDS payment dates, define new maturity dates. Using the period
from three to five years (CDS standard dates), maturities are defined within this range spaced at
quarterly intervals (measuring time from the valuation date).

Settle = '17-Jul-2009';  % Valuation date for the CDS
MarketDates = datenum({'20-Sep-10','20-Sep-11','20-Sep-12','20-Sep-14', ...
'20-Sep-16'});
MarketSpreads = [140 175 210 265 310]';
MarketData = [MarketDates MarketSpreads];
ZeroDates = datenum({'17-Jan-10','17-Jul-10','17-Jul-11','17-Jul-12', ...
'17-Jul-13','17-Jul-14'});
ZeroRates = [1.35 1.43 1.9 2.47 2.936 3.311]'/100;
ZeroData = [ZeroDates ZeroRates];

[ProbData,HazData] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle);

Maturity1 = datestr(daysadd('17-Jul-09',360*(3.25:0.25:5),1));
Spread1 = cdsspread(ZeroData,ProbData,Settle,Maturity1);
