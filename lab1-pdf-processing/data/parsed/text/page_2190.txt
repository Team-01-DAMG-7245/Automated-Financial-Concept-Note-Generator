ecmnfish

Fisher information matrix

Syntax

Fisher = ecmnfish(Data,Covariance)
Fisher = ecmnfish( ___ ,InvCovar,MatrixType)

Description

Fisher = ecmnfish(Data,Covariance) computes an NUMPARAMS-by-NUMPARAMS Fisher
information matrix based on the current maximum likelihood parameter estimates.

Use ecmnfish after estimating the mean and covariance of Data with ecmnmle.

Fisher = ecmnfish( ___ ,InvCovar,MatrixType) adds optional arguments for InvCovar and
MatrixType.

Examples

Compute Fisher Information Matrix Based on Parameter Estimates for Data

This example shows how to compute the Fisher information matrix based on parameter estimates for
Data for five years of daily total returns for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and
six software companies

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

[ECMMean, ECMCovar] = ecmnmle(Data)

ECMMean = 12×1
