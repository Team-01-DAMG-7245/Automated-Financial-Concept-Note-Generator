Technically, the numbers after these ages are 0, but can also be NaN values because no person is alive
after these terminating ages. Second, the probabilities qx on the right terminate with fluctuating
probabilities that go from 0 to 1 in some cases. In this case, however, all probabilities are 1qx
probabilities (unlike the forced termination probabilities). You can argue that the probabilities after
the ages of termination can be 1 (anyone alive at this age is expected to die in the next year), 0 (the
age lies outside the support of the probability distribution), or NaN values.

Truncated Termination

Truncated termination occurs with truncation of life tables at an arbitrary age. For example, from
1970–1990, United States life tables truncated at age 85. This format is problematic because life
table probabilities must either terminate with probability 1 (forced termination) or discard data that
exceeds the terminating age. This sample of the last few years of a life table illustrates truncated
termination. The raw data for this table is the lx series. The qx series is derived from this series.

This life table format poses problems for termination because, for example, over 27% of the
population for the fourth lx series is still alive at age 85. To claim that the probability of dying for all
ages after age 85 is 100% might be true but is uninformative. Notwithstanding the statistical issues,
however, tables in this form are completed by forced termination.
