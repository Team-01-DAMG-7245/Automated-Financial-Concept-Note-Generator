The differences between this approach and the one presented in the previous section are quite
evident. Requiring all the assets to have a WoB percentage of at least 35% gives an efficient frontier

that can achieve a return of at most around 1 . 2 10 −3. On the other hand, requiring only that the
portfolio's average percentage of WoB is 36.57% gives the possibility to reach a return of around

3 . 2 10 −3, almost 2.5 times the return obtained when excluding assets. To better show the
differences between these two approaches, compute the maximum return achieved for a given
standard deviation for the two ways of including the percentage of WoB requirements to the portfolio.

Approach 1

In the first approach, exclude all assets with a WoB percentage lower than 33% and find the portfolio
of maximum return that has a standard deviation of at most 0.012.

% Select the assets to exclude.
ub = zeros(p.NumAssets,1);
ub(WoB >= 0.33) = 1;
p.UpperBound = ub;
% Estimate the return for a risk level of 0.012.
pwgt_exclude = estimateFrontierByRisk(p,0.012);
ret_exclude = estimatePortReturn(p,pwgt_exclude)

ret_exclude = 
0.0011

% Return the constraints to the original portfolio.
p.UpperBound = [];

Approach 2

For the second approach, ensure that the average WoB percentage is of at least 33% and find the
portfolio of maximum return that has a standard deviation of at most 0.012.
