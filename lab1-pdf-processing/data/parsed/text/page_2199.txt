Algorithms

Model

The general model is

Z ∼N Mean, Covariance ,

where each row of Data is an observation of Z.

Each observation of Z is assumed to be iid (independent, identically distributed) multivariate normal,
and missing values are assumed to be missing at random (MAR).

Initialization Methods

This routine has three initialization methods that cover most cases, each with its advantages and
disadvantages.

nanskip

The nanskip method works well with small problems (fewer than 10 series or with monotone
missing data patterns). It skips over any records with NaNs and estimates initial values from
complete-data records only. This initialization method tends to yield fastest convergence of the ECM
algorithm. This routine switches to the twostage method if it determines that significant numbers of
records contain NaN.

twostage

The twostage method is the best choice for large problems (more than 10 series). It estimates the
mean for each series using all available data for each series. It then estimates the covariance matrix
with missing values treated as equal to the mean rather than as NaNs. This initialization method is
robust but tends to result in slower convergence of the ECM algorithm.

diagonal

The diagonal method is a worst-case approach that deals with problematic data, such as disjoint
series and excessive missing data (more than 33% missing data). Of the three initialization methods,
this method causes the slowest convergence of the ECM algorithm.
