•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

Note By default, SIA bases (0-7) and BUS/252 use a semiannual compounding convention and ICMA
bases (8-12) use an annual compounding convention.

Data Types: double

DiscountBasis — Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield
SIA bases uses 0 (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'DiscountBasis' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.
Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If a SIA day-count basis is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value assigned
for DiscountBasis, the default behavior is for SIA bases to use the actual/actual day count to
compute discount factors.

If an ICMA day-count basis or BUS/252 is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value
assigned for DiscountBasis, the specified bases from the Basis input argument are used.

LastCouponInterest — Compounding convention for computing yield of a bond in last
coupon period
compound (default) | values are simple or compound

Compounding convention for computing the yield of a bond in the last coupon period, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'LastCouponInterest' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-
