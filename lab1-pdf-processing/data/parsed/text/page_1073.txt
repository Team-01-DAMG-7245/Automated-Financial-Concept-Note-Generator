with fixed covariance C0.

In most cases, C0 is a diagonal matrix. The inverse matrix W = C0
−1 has diagonal elements that can be
considered relative “weights” for each series. Thus, CWLS is a form of weighted least squares with
the weights applied across series.

Covariance-Weighted Least Squares Without Missing Data

Estimate parameters using mvnrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = mvnrmle(Data, Design, 1, [], [], [], Covar0);

Estimate standard errors using mvnrstd:

StdParameters = mvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Covariance-Weighted Least Squares With Missing Data

Estimate parameters using ecmlsrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = ecmlsrmle(Data, Design, [], [], [], [], Covar0);

Estimate standard errors using ecmmvnrstd:

StdParameters = ecmmvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Feasible Generalized Least Squares

An ad hoc form of least squares that has surprisingly good properties for misspecified or nonnormal
models is known as feasible generalized least squares, or FGLS. The basic procedure is to do least-
squares regression and then to do covariance-weighted least-squares regression with the resultant
residual covariance from the first regression.

Feasible Generalized Least Squares Without Missing Data

Estimate parameters using mvnrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = mvnrmle(Data, Design, 2, 0, 0);

or (to illustrate the FGLS process explicitly)

[Parameters, Covar0] = mvnrmle(Data, Design, 1);
[Parameters, Covariance] = mvnrmle(Data, Design, 1, [], [], [], Covar0);

Estimate standard errors using mvnrstd:

StdParameters = mvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);
