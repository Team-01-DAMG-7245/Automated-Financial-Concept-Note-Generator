NumPorts — Number of portfolios to calculate on each frontier
positive integer

Number of portfolios to calculate on each frontier, specified as a positive integer.

Data Types: double

ActiveMap — Indicates if an asset is part of the Universe on the corresponding date
NUMOBS-by-NASSETS matrix of 1's (all assets active on all dates) (default) | matrix

(Optional) Indicates if an asset is part of the Universe on the corresponding date, specified as a
number of observations (NUMOBS) by number of assets (NASSETS) matrix with Boolean elements
corresponding to the Universe.

Data Types: double

Conset — Constraint matrix for a portfolio of asset investments
matrix

Constraint matrix for a portfolio of asset investments, specified using portcons with the 'Default'
constraint type. This single constraint matrix is applied to each frontier..

Data Types: double

NumNonNan — Minimum number of non-NaN points for each active asset in each window of
data
Window - NASSETS (default) | numeric value

Minimum number of non-NaN points for each active asset in each window of data needed to perform
the optimization, specified as a numeric value.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

PortWts — Weights allocated to each asset
matrix

Weights allocated to each asset., returned as a number of curves (NCURVES)-by-1 cell array, where
each element is a NPORTS-by-NASSETS matrix of weights.

AllMean — Expected asset returns used to generate each curve on the surface
vector

Expected asset returns used to generate each curve on the surface, returned as an NCURVES-by-1 cell
array, where each element is a 1-by-NASSETS vector of the expected asset returns.

AllCovariance — Covariance matrix used to generate each curve on the surface
vector

Covariance matrix used to generate each curve on the surface, returned as an NCURVES-by-1 cell
array, where each element is a NASSETS-by-NASSETS vector.
