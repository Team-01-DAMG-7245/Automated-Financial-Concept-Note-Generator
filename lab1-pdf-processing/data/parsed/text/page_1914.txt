Input Arguments

Data — Data for opening, high, low, and closing prices
matrix | table | timetable

Data for opening, high, low, and closing prices, specified as a matrix, table, or timetable. For matrix
input, Data is an M-by-4 matrix of opening, high, low, and closing prices stored in the corresponding
columns. Timetables and tables with M rows must contain variables named 'Open', 'High', 'Low',
and 'Close' (case insensitive).

Data Types: double | table | timetable

Color — (Optional) Three element color vector
background color of figure window (default) | color vector [R G B] | string

Three element color vector, specified as a [R G B] color vector or a string specifying the color name.
The default color differs depending on the background color of the figure window.

RGB triplets and hexadecimal color codes are useful for specifying custom colors.

•
An RGB triplet is a three-element row vector whose elements specify the intensities of the red,
green, and blue components of the color. The intensities must be in the range [0,1]; for example,
[0.4 0.6 0.7].

•
A hexadecimal color code is a character vector or a string scalar that starts with a hash symbol (#)
followed by three or six hexadecimal digits, which can range from 0 to F. The values are not case
sensitive. Thus, the color codes "#FF8800", "#ff8800", "#F80", and "#f80" are equivalent.

Alternatively, you can specify some common colors by name. This table lists the named color options,
the equivalent RGB triplets, and hexadecimal color codes.
