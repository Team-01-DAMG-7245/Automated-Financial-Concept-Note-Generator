ecmlsrobj

Log-likelihood function for least-squares regression with missing data

Syntax

Objective = ecmlsrobj(Data,Design,Parameters)
Objective = ecmlsrobj( ___ ,Covariance)

Description

Objective = ecmlsrobj(Data,Design,Parameters) computes a least-squares objective
function based on current parameter estimates with missing data. Objective is a scalar that
contains the least-squares objective function.

Objective = ecmlsrobj( ___ ,Covariance) computes a least-squares objective function based
on current parameter estimates with missing data using an optional argument.

Input Arguments

Data — Data sample
matrix

Data sample, specified as an NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMSERIES matrix with NUMSAMPLES samples of a
NUMSERIES-dimensional random vector. If a data sample has missing values, represented as NaNs.
Only samples that are entirely NaNs are ignored. (To ignore samples with at least one NaN, use
mvnrmle.)

Data Types: double

Design — Model design
matrix | cell array of character vectors

Model design, specified as a matrix or a cell array that handles two model structures:

•
If NUMSERIES = 1, Design is a NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix with known values. This
structure is the standard form for regression on a single series.

•
If NUMSERIES ≥ 1, Design is a cell array. The cell array contains either one or NUMSAMPLES cells.
Each cell contains a NUMSERIES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix of known values.

If Design has a single cell, it is assumed to have the same Design matrix for each sample. If
Design has more than one cell, each cell contains a Design matrix for each sample.

Data Types: double | cell

Parameters — Estimates for the parameters of regression model
vector

Estimates for the parameters of regression model, specified as an NUMPARAMS-by-1 column vector.

Data Types: double
