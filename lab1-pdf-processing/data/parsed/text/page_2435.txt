Find Multiple Internal Rates of Return

Find the internal rate of return for multiple rates of return. The project has the following cash flows
and a market rate of 10%.

CashFlow = [-1000 6000 -10900 5800]

CashFlow = 1×4

-1000        6000      -10900        5800

[Return, AllRates] = irr(CashFlow)

Return = 
1.0000

AllRates = 3×1

-0.0488
    1.0000
    2.0488

The rates of return in AllRates are -4.88%, 100%, and 204.88%. Though some rates are lower and
some higher than the market rate, based on the work of Hazen, any rate gives a consistent
recommendation on the project. However, you can use a present value analysis in these kinds of
situations. To check the present value of the project, use pvvar:

PV = pvvar(CashFlow,0.10)

PV = 
-196.0932

The second argument is the 10% market rate. The present value is -196.0932, negative, so the project
is undesirable.

Input Arguments

CashFlow — Stream of periodic cash flows
vector | matrix

Stream of periodic cash flows, specified as a vector or matrix. The first entry in CashFlow is the
initial investment. If CashFlow is a matrix, irr handles each column of CashFlow as a separate
cash-flow stream.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

Return — Internal rate of return
vector

Internal rate of return associated to CashFlow, returned as a vector whose entry j is an internal rate
of return for column j in CashFlow
