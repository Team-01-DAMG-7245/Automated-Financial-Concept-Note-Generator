hwv

Hull-White/Vasicek (HWV) Gaussian Diffusion model

Description

Create and displays a hwv object, which derives from the sdemrd (SDE with drift rate expressed in
mean-reverting form) class.

Use hwv objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables expressed in mean-reverting drift-
rate form. These state variables are driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over
NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time Hull-White/Vasicek
stochastic processes with Gaussian diffusions.

This model allows you to simulate vector-valued Hull-White/Vasicek processes of the form:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + V(t)dWt
 (15-2)

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars of mean reversion speeds (the rate of mean reversion).

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels (long-run mean or level).

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWtis an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Creation

Syntax

HWV = hwv(Speed,Level,Sigma)
HWV = hwv( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

HWV = hwv(Speed,Level,Sigma) creates a default HWV object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.

•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.

Note You can specify combinations of array and function input parameters as needed.
