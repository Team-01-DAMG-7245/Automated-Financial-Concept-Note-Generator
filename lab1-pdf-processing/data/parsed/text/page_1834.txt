13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If a SIA day-count basis is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value assigned
for DiscountBasis, the default behavior is for SIA bases to use the actual/actual day count to
compute discount factors.

If an ICMA day-count basis or BUS/252 is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value
assigned for DiscountBasis, the specified bases from the Basis input argument are used.

Data Types: double

LastCouponInterest — Compounding convention for computing yield of a bond in last
coupon period
compound (default) | values are simple or compound

Compounding convention for computing the yield of a bond in the last coupon period, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'LastCouponInterest' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-
by-NUMBONDS vector. LastCouponInterest is based on only the last coupon and the face value to
be repaid. Acceptable values are:

•
simple

•
compound

Data Types: char | cell

Output Arguments

YearConvexity — Yearly (annualized) convexity
numeric

Yearly (annualized) convexity, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

PerConvexity — Periodic convexity reported on semiannual bond basis
numeric

Periodic convexity reported on a semiannual bond basis (in accordance with SIA convention),
returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

More About

Bond Convexity

Bond convexity is a measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and bond
yields.

Bond convexity quantifies how much the price of a bond changes in response to changes in interest
rates, taking into account the nonlinear relationship between price and yield. Convexity is an
important concept in fixed-income investing because it helps investors understand the sensitivity of a
bond's price to interest rate movements beyond what is captured by duration alone.
