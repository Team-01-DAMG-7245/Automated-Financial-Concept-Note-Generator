To create an equally weighted portfolio of four assets, use setInitPort:

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setInitPort(p, 1/4, 4);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.2500
 0.2500
 0.2500
 0.2500

PortfolioMAD object functions that work with either transaction costs or turnover constraints also
depend on the InitPort property. So, the set functions for transaction costs or turnover constraints
permit the assignment of a value for the InitPort property as part of their implementation. For
details, see “Working with Average Turnover Constraints Using PortfolioMAD Object” on page 6-74,
“Working with One-Way Turnover Constraints Using PortfolioMAD Object” on page 6-77, and
“Working with Transaction Costs” on page 6-46. If either transaction costs or turnover constraints
are used, then the InitPort property must have a nonempty value. Absent a specific value assigned
through the PortfolioMAD object or various set functions, the PortfolioMAD object sets
InitPort to 0 and warns if BuyCost, SellCost, or Turnover properties are set. This example
shows what happens if you specify an average turnover constraint with an initial portfolio:

p = PortfolioMAD('Turnover', 0.3, 'InitPort', [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ]);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.3000
 0.2000
 0.2000
      0

In contrast, this example shows what happens if an average turnover constraint is specified without
an initial portfolio:

p = PortfolioMAD('Turnover', 0.3);
disp(p.InitPort)

Warning: InitPort and NumAssets are empty and either transaction costs or
turnover constraints specified. Will set NumAssets = 1 and InitPort = 0.
