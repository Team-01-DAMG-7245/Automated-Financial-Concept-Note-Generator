Obtain Group Constraints for a PortfolioCVaR Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets
constitute at most 30% of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioCVaR object p with the group constraints
set, obtain the values for GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, and UpperGroup.

G = [ true true true false false ];
p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
[GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, UpperGroup] = getGroups(p)

GroupMatrix = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

LowerGroup =

[]

UpperGroup = 
0.3000

Obtain Group Constraints for a PortfolioMAD Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets
constitute at most 30% of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p with the group constraints
set, obtain the values for GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, and UpperGroup.

G = [ true true true false false ];
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
[GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, UpperGroup] = getGroups(p)

GroupMatrix = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

LowerGroup =

[]

UpperGroup = 
0.3000
