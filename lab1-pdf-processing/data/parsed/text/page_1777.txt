Note If t = 1, then Y = exp(X).

The arith2geom function has no restriction on the input mean ma but requires the input covariance
Ca to be a symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix.

The functions arith2geom and geom2arith are complementary so that, given m, C, and t, the
sequence

[mg,Cg] = arith2geom(m,C,t);       
[ma,Ca] = geom2arith(mg,Cg,1/t);

yields ma = m and Ca = C.
