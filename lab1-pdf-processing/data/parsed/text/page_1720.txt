Because time series arrays represent dynamic behavior that must be captured by functions accessible
by the t, Xt  interface, you need utilities to convert traditional time series arrays into callable
functions of time and state. The following example shows how to do this using the conversion function
ts2func (time series to function).

Load a daily historical data set containing three-month Euribor rates and closing index levels of
France's CAC 40 spanning the time interval February 7, 2001 to April 24, 2006.

load Data_GlobalIdx2

Simulate risk-neutral sample paths of the CAC 40 index using a geometric Brownian motion (GBM)
model:

where r(t) represents evolution of the risk-free rate of return.

Furthermore, assume that you need to annualize the relevant information derived from the daily data
(annualizing the data is optional, but is useful for comparison to other examples), and that each
calendar year comprises 250 trading days.

dt      = 1/250;
returns = tick2ret(Dataset.CAC);
sigma   = std(returns)*sqrt(250);
yields  = Dataset.EB3M;
yields  = 360*log(1 + yields);

Compare the resulting sample paths obtained from two risk-neutral historical simulation approaches,
where the daily Euribor yields serve as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return.

The first approach specifies the risk-neutral return as the sample average of Euribor yields, and
therefore assumes a constant (non-dynamic) risk-free return.

nPeriods = length(yields);  % Simulated observations
rng(5713,'twister')
obj    = gbm(mean(yields),diag(sigma),'StartState',100)

obj = 
   Class GBM: Generalized Geometric Brownian Motion
   ------------------------------------------------
     Dimensions: State = 1, Brownian = 1
   ------------------------------------------------
      StartTime: 0
     StartState: 100
    Correlation: 1
          Drift: drift rate function F(t,X(t)) 
      Diffusion: diffusion rate function G(t,X(t)) 
     Simulation: simulation method/function simByEuler
         Return: 0.0278117
          Sigma: 0.231906

[X1,T] = simulate(obj,nPeriods,'DeltaTime',dt);

In contrast, the second approach specifies the risk-neutral return as the historical time series of
Euribor yields. It therefore assumes a dynamic, yet deterministic, rate of return; this example does
not illustrate stochastic interest rates. To illustrate this dynamic effect, use the ts2func utility.
