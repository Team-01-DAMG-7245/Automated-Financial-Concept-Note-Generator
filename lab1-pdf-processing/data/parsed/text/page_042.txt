MATLAB performs the same computation on all the assets at once. For the three cash flow streams,
the irr function returns a vector of three internal rates of return.

In the Financial Toolbox context, vectorized programming is useful in portfolio management. You can
organize multiple assets into a single collection by placing data for each asset in a different matrix
column or row, then pass the matrix to a Financial Toolbox function.

Character Vector Input

Enter MATLAB character vectors surrounded by single quotes ('character vector').

A character vector is stored as a character array, one ASCII character per element. Thus, the date
character vector is

DateCharacterVector = '9/16/2017'

This date character vector is actually a 1-by-9 vector. If you create a vector or matrix of character
vectors, each character vector must have the same length. Using a column vector to create a vector
of character vectors can allow you to visually check that all character vectors are the same length. If
your character vectors are not the same length, use spaces or zeros to make them the same length, as
in the following code.

DateFields = ['01/12/2017'
              '02/14/2017'
              '03/03/2017'
              '06/14/2017'
              '12/01/2017'];

DateFields is a 5-by-10 array of character vectors.

You cannot mix numbers and character vectors in a vector or matrix. If you input a vector or matrix
that contains a mix of numbers and character vectors, MATLAB treats every entry as a character. As
an example, input the following code

Item = [83  90  99 '14-Sep-1999']

Item =

SZc14-Sep-1999

The software understands the input not as a 1-by-4 vector, but as a 1-by-14 character array with the
value SZc14-Sep-1999.

Output Arguments

Some functions return no arguments, some return just one, and some return multiple arguments.
Functions that return multiple arguments use the syntax

[A, B, C] = function(input_arguments...)

to return arguments A, B, and C. If you omit all but one, the function returns the first argument. Thus,
for this example if you use the syntax
