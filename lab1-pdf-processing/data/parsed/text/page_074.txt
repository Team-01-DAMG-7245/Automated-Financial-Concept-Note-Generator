Use a bootstrapping function to derive an implied zero curve. Bootstrapping is a process whereby you
begin with known data points and solve for unknown data points using an underlying arbitrage
theory. Every coupon bond can be valued as a package of zero-coupon bonds which mimic its cash
flow and risk characteristics. By mapping yields-to-maturity for each theoretical zero-coupon bond, to
the dates spanning the investment horizon, you can create a theoretical zero-rate curve. The
Financial Toolbox™ software provides two bootstrapping functions: zbtprice derives a zero curve
from bond data and prices, and zbtyield derives a zero curve from bond data and yields. Using
zbtprice

[ZeroRates, CurveDates] = zbtprice(Bonds, Prices, Settle)

Use the functions zero2disc, zero2fwd, and zero2pyld to construct discount, forward, and par
yield curves from the zero curve, and vice versa.
