Cash = [100  70
         80  40];

Units = [10
        20];

Receipts = Cash * Units

Receipts =

2400
       1600

Now the investor asks this question: Given these two portfolios and their characteristics, how many
units of each should they hold to receive $7000 if the prime rate stays flat and $5000 if the prime
drops one percentage point? Find the answer by solving two linear equations.

M1
M2

Prime flat:
$100 * x units
+ $70 * y units = $7000
receipts

Prime down:
$80 * x units
+ $40 * y units = $5000
receipts

In other words, solve for U (units) in the equation R (receipts) = C (cash) * U (units). Using MATLAB
left division

Cash = [100  70
         80  40];

Receipts = [7000
            5000];

Units = Cash \ Receipts

Units =

43.7500
         37.5000

The investor should hold 43.75 units of portfolio M1 and 37.5 units of portfolio M2 to achieve the
annual receipts desired.

Operating Element by Element

Finally, element-by-element arithmetic operations are called operations. To indicate a MATLAB array
operation, precede the operator with a period (.). Addition and subtraction, and matrix multiplication
and division by a scalar, are already array operations so no period is necessary. When using array
operations on two matrices, the dimensions of the matrices must be the same. For example, given
vectors of stock dividends and closing prices

Dividends = [1.90  0.40  1.56  4.50];
Prices = [25.625  17.75  26.125  60.50];

Yields = Dividends ./ Prices
