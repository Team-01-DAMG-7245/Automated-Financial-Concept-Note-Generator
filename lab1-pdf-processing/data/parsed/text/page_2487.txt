Examples

Compute Modified Internal Rate of Return

This cash flow represents the yearly income from an initial investment of $100,000. The finance rate
is 9% and the reinvestment rate is 12%.

Year 1 $20,000

Year 2 ($10,000)

Year 3 $30,000

Year 4 $38,000

Year 5 $50,000

To calculate the modified internal rate of return on the investment:

Return = mirr([-100000 20000 -10000 30000 38000 50000], 0.09,0.12)

Return = 
0.0832
