Here:

μj is the mean of J(μj > -1).

ƛp is the annual frequency (intensity) of the Poisson process Pt (ƛp ≥ 0).

σM is the volatility of the asset price (σM> 0).

Under this formulation, extreme events are explicitly included in the stochastic differential equation
as randomly occurring discontinuous jumps in the diffusion trajectory. Therefore, the disparity
between observed tail behavior of log returns and that of Brownian motion is mitigated by the
inclusion of a jump mechanism.
