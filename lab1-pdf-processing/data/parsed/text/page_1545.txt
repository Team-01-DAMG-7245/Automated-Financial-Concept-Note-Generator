Note If the lookback minimum is non-zero, the software does not call the rebalance function
(rebalanceFcn) until at least the lookback minimum time steps have passed before the current
rebalancing period. This is regardless of the value of the rebalance frequency
(RebalanceFrequency).

InitialWeights — Initial portfolio weights

Initial portfolio weights, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'InitialWeights'
and a vector. The InitialWeights vector sets the portfolio weights before the backtestEngine

used in the backtest.

Alternatively, you can set the InitialWeights name-value pair argument to empty ([]) to indicate
the strategy will begin with no investments and in a 100% cash position. The default for
InitialWeights is empty ([ ]).
