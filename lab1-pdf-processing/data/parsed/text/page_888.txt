Plotting the Efficient Frontier for a PortfolioMAD Object

This example shows how to use the plotFrontier function creates a plot of the efficient frontier for
a given portfolio optimization problem. This function accepts several types of inputs and generates a
plot with an optional possibility to output the estimates for portfolio risks and returns along the
efficient frontier. plotFrontier has four different ways that it can be used. In addition to a plot of
the efficient frontier, if you have an initial portfolio in the InitPort property, plotFrontier also
displays the return versus risk of the initial portfolio on the same plot. If you have a well-posed
portfolio optimization problem set up in a PortfolioMAD object and you use plotFrontier, you
get a plot of the efficient frontier with the default number of portfolios on the frontier (the default
number is currently 10 and is maintained in the hidden property defaultNumPorts).

Create Efficient Frontier Plot

To plot the efficient frontier for a PortflioMAD object, use of plotFrontier.

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
    0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
    0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
    0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];
m = m/12;
C = C/12;

AssetScenarios = mvnrnd(m, C, 20000);

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setScenarios(p, AssetScenarios);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

plotFrontier(p)
