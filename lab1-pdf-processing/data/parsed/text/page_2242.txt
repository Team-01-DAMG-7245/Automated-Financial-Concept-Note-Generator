Tips

You can also use dot notation to estimate the mean and covariance of asset returns from data.

obj = obj.estimateAssetMoments(AssetReturns);

Version History
Introduced in R2011a

R2018a: Support for timetable input for AssetReturns
Behavior changed in R2018a

Using a fints object for the AssetReturns argument of estimateAssetMoments is not
recommended. Use timetable instead for financial time series. For more information, see “Convert
Financial Time Series Objects (fints) to Timetables” on page 11-2.
