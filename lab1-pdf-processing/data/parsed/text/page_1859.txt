Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: KeyRateDuration =
bndkrdur(ZeroData,.0525,'12/31/1998','11/15/2028','KeyRates',[2 5 10 30])

InterpMethod — Interpolation method used to obtain points from zero curve
'linear' (default) | 'cubic', 'pchip'

Interpolation method used to obtain points from the zero curve, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'InterpMethod' and a character vector using one of the following values:

•
'linear' (default)

•
'cubic'

•
'pchip'

Data Types: char

ShiftValue — Value that zero curve is shifted up and down to compute duration
.01 (100 basis points) (default) | numeric

Value that zero curve is shifted up and down to compute duration, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'ShiftValue' and a scalar numeric value.

Data Types: double

KeyRates — Rates to perform the duration calculation
set to each of the zero dates (default) | numeric

Rates to perform the duration calculation, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'KeyRates' and a time to maturity using a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

CurveCompounding — Compounding frequency of curve
2 (default) | integer with value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12

Compounding frequency of the curve, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'CurveCompounding' and a scalar using one of the following values:

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding
