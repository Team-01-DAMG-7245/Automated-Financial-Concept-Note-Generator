The sde object displays like a MATLAB® structure, with the following information:

•
The object's class

•
A brief description of the object

•
A brief description of the object

The object's displayed parameters are as follows:

•
StartTime: The initial observation time (real-valued scalar).

•
StartState: The initial state vector (NVars-by-1 column vector).

•
Correlation: The correlation structure between Brownian process.

•
Drift: The drift-rate function F t, Xt .

•
Diffusion: The diffusion-rate function G t, Xt .

•
Simulation: The simulation method or function.

Of these displayed parameters, only Drift and Diffusion are required inputs.

The only exception to the (t, Xt) evaluation interface is Correlation. Specifically, when you enter
Correlation as a function, the SDE engine assumes that it is a deterministic function of time, C t .
This restriction on Correlation as a deterministic function of time allows Cholesky factors to be
computed and stored before the formal simulation. This inconsistency dramatically improves run-time
performance for dynamic correlation structures. If Correlation is stochastic, you can also include it
within the simulation architecture as part of a more general random number generation function.
