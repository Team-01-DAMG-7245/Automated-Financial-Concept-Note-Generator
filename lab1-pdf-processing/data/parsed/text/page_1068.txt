Financial Toolbox software has a number of functions for multivariate normal regression with or
without missing data. The toolbox functions solve four classes of regression problems with functions
to estimate parameters, standard errors, log-likelihood functions, and Fisher information matrices.
The four classes of regression problems are:

Additional support functions are also provided, see “Support Functions” on page 9-12.

In all functions, the MATLAB representation for the number of observations (or samples) is
NumSamples = m, the number of data series is NumSeries = n, and the number of model
parameters is NumParams = p. The moment estimation functions have NumSeries = NumParams.

The collection of observations (or samples) is stored in a MATLAB matrix Data such that

Data k,  : = zk
T

for k = 1, ..., NumSamples, where Data is a NumSamples-by-NumSeries matrix.

For the multivariate normal regression or least-squares functions, an additional required input is the
collection of design matrices that is stored as either a MATLAB matrix or a vector of cell arrays
denoted as Design.

If Numseries = 1, Design can be a NumSamples-by-NumParams matrix. This is the “standard” form
for regression on a single data series.

If Numseries = 1, Design can be either a cell array with a single cell or a cell array with
NumSamples cells. Each cell in the cell array contains a NumSeries-by-NumParams matrix such that

Design k
= Hk

for k = 1, ..., NumSamples. If Design has a single cell, it is assumed to be the same Design
matrix for each sample such that

Design 1
= H1 = … = Hm .

Otherwise, Design must contain individual design matrices for each sample.

The main distinction among the four classes of regression problems depends upon how missing
values are handled and where missing values are represented as the MATLAB value NaN. If a sample
