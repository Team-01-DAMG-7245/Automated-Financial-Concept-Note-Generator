Use 'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets, and MaxNumAssets Constraints with Other
Constraints

You can define other constraints for a Portfolio object using the set functions. These other
constraints for a Portfolio object, such as group, linear inequality, turnover, and tracking error can
be used together with the 'Conditional' BoundType, 'MinNumAssets', and 'MaxNumAssets'
constraints. For example, specify a tracking error constraint using setTrackingError.

ii = [15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30];    % indexes of assets to include in tracking portfoli
trackingPort(ii) = 1/numel(ii);
q = setTrackingError(p, 0.5, trackingPort);

Then use setMinMaxNumAssets to add a constraint to limit maximum number of assets to invest.

q = setMinMaxNumAssets(q, [], 8);

On top of these previously specified constraints, use setBounds to add a constraint to limit the
weight for the allocated assets. You can use constraints with mixed BoundType values, where
'Simple' means lb ≤xi ≤ub and 'Conditional' means xi = 0 or lb ≤xi ≤ub.

Allow the assets in trackingPort to have the BoundType value 'Conditional' in the optimum
allocation.

lb = zeros(q.NumAssets, 1);
ub = zeros(q.NumAssets, 1)*0.5;
lb(ii) = 0.1;
ub(ii) = 0.3;
