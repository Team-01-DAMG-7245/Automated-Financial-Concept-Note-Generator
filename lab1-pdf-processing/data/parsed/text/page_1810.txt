Rho

A rho sensitivity measures the rate at which the price of an option is expected to change in response
to a change in the risk-free interest rate.

Rho is expressed as the amount of money an option's price would gain or lose for a one percentage
point (1%) change in the risk-free interest rate. For instance, if a call option has a rho of 0.05, it
means that for every one percentage point increase in interest rates, the price of the call option is
expected to increase by $0.05.
