The returns have the correct size (66%, 300%, 50%, 200%), but do they have the correct sign? If you
interpret negative returns as losses, as with the positive price series, the signs seem wrong—the last
two returns should be gains (that is, if you interpret less negative to be a gain). However, if you
interpret the negative returns by the formula

ps(t) = ps(t −1) + PC ⋅ps(t −1),

which requires the signs, the last two negative percentage changes multiply negative prices ps(t − 1),
which produces positive additions to ps(t − 1). Briefly, a negative return on a negative price produces
a positive price movement. The returns are correct.

The round trip produced by ret2tick returns the original price series.

ps = ret2tick(rs,StartPrice=3)

ps =

3
     1
    -2
    -1
     1

Also, the following computations shows that time aggregation holds.

p(5)/p(1) - 1

ans =

-0.6667

prod(rs + 1) - 1

ans =

-0.6667

For continuous returns, negative price ratios pc(t)/pc(t − 1) are interpreted as complex numbers with
phase angles ±π, and the complex logarithm is invoked.

rc = tick2ret(p,Method="continuous")

rc =

-1.0986 + 0.0000i
   0.6931 + 3.1416i
  -0.6931 + 0.0000i
   0.0000 - 3.1416i
