If StartState is a column vector, cev applies a unique initial value to each state variable on all
trials.

If StartState is a matrix, cev applies a unique initial value to each state variable on each trial.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
NBrowns-by-NBrowns identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) |
positive semidefinite matrix | deterministic function

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as an NBrowns-by-NBrowns positive semidefinite matrix, or as a
deterministic function C(t) that accepts the current time t and returns an NBrowns-by-NBrowns
positive semidefinite correlation matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite
matrix, use nearcorr to create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

A Correlation matrix represents a static condition.

As a deterministic function of time, Correlation allows you to specify a dynamic correlation
structure.

Data Types: double

Simulation — User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method
simulation by Euler approximation (simByEuler) (default) | function | SDE simulation method

User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method, specified as a function or SDE simulation
method.

Data Types: function_handle

Drift — Drift rate component of continuous-time stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
value stored from drift-rate function (default) | drift object or function accessible by (t, Xt)

This property is read-only.

Drift rate component of continuous-time stochastic differential equations (SDEs), specified as a drift
object or function accessible by (t, Xt.

The drift rate specification supports the simulation of sample paths of NVars state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods,
approximating continuous-time stochastic processes.

The drift class allows you to create drift-rate objects using drift of the form:

F(t, Xt) = A(t) + B(t)Xt

where:

•
A is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

•
B is an NVars-by-NVars matrix-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

The displayed parameters for a drift object are:
