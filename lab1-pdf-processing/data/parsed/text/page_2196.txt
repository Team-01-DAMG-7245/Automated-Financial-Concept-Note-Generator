Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the covariance of the Data using the ECM algorithm,
specified as a NUMSERIES-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

InvCovar — Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrix
[ ] (default) | matrix

(Optional) Inverse of covariance matrix, specified as a matrix using inv as:

inv(Covariance)

Data Types: double

MatrixType — Matrix format
'full' (default) | character vector

(Optional) Matrix format, specified as a character vector with a value of:

•
'full' — Computes the full Hessian matrix.

•
'meanonly' — Computes only the components of the Hessian matrix associated with the mean.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

Hessian — Hessian matrix
matrix

Hessian matrix, returned as an NUMPARAMSNUMPARAMS matrix of the observed log-likelihood function
based on current parameter estimates, where NUMPARAMS = NUMSERIES * (NUMSERIES + 3)/2
if the MatrixFormat = 'full'. If the MatrixFormat = 'meanonly', then the NUMPARAMS =
NUMSERIES.

More About

Hessian Matrix

The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function.

The Hessian matrix is a key concept in optimization, particularly in the context of multivariable
calculus, and is used to study the local curvature of functions. The Hessian matrix provides important
information about the behavior of functions near critical points, which are points where the gradient
(first derivative) is zero.
