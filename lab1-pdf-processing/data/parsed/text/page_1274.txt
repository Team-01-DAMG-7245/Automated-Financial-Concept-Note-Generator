American Option Pricing Using the Longstaff & Schwartz Approach

Now that the copulas have been calibrated, compare the prices of at-the-money American basket
options derived from various approaches. To simply the analysis, assume that:

•
All indices begin at 100.

•
The portfolio holds a single unit, or share, of each index such that the value of the portfolio at any
time is the sum of the values of the individual indices.

•
The option expires in 3 months.

•
The information derived from the daily data is annualized.

•
Each calendar year is composed of 252 trading days.

•
Index levels are simulated daily.

•
The option may be exercised at the end of every trading day and approximates the American
option as a Bermudan option.

Now compute the parameters common to all simulation methods:

dt       = 1 / 252;                  % Time increment = 1 day = 1/252 years
yields   = Data(:,end);              % Daily effective yields
yields   = 360 * log(1 + yields);    % Continuously-compounded, annualized yields
r        = mean(yields);             % Historical 3M Euribor average
X        = repmat(100, nIndices, 1); % Initial state vector
