Examine Detailed Results

After you run the backtest, the backtestEngine object updates the read-only fields with the
detailed results of the backtest. The Returns, Positions, Turnover, BuyCost, SellCost, and
Fees properties each contain a timetable of results. Since this example uses daily price data in the
backtest, these timetables hold daily results.
