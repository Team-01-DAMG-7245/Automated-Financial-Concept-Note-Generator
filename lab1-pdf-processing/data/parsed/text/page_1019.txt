Bootstrapping a Default Probability Curve

This example shows how to price a new CDS contract by first estimating a default probability term
structure using cdsbootstrap.

The folowing code demonstrates how to bootstrap default probabilities from CDS market quotes. To
bootstrap default probabilities from bond market data, see bondDefaultBootstrap. In a typical
workflow, pricing a new CDS contract involves first estimating a default probability term structure
using cdsbootstrap. This requires market quotes of existing CDS contracts, or quotes of CDS
indices (for example, iTraxx). The estimated default probability curve is then used as input to
cdsspread or cdsprice. If the default probability information is already known, cdsbootstrap
can be bypassed and cdsspread or cdsprice can be called directly.

The market information in this example is provided in the form of running spreads of CDS contracts
maturing on the CDS standard payment dates closest to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 years from the valuation
date.

Settle = '17-Jul-2009'; % Valuation date for the CDS
MarketDates = datenum({'20-Sep-10','20-Sep-11','20-Sep-12','20-Sep-14', ...
'20-Sep-16'});
MarketSpreads = [140 175 210 265 310]';
MarketData = [MarketDates MarketSpreads];
ZeroDates = datenum({'17-Jan-10','17-Jul-10','17-Jul-11','17-Jul-12', ...
'17-Jul-13','17-Jul-14'});
ZeroRates = [1.35 1.43 1.9 2.47 2.936 3.311]'/100;
ZeroData = [ZeroDates ZeroRates];

[ProbData,HazData] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle);

The bootstrapped default probability curve is plotted against time, in years, from the valuation date.

ProbTimes = yearfrac(Settle,ProbData(:,1));
