cdprice

Price of certificate of deposit

Syntax

[Price,AccrInt] = cdprice(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate)
[PriceAccrInt] = cdprice( ___ ,Basis)

Description

[Price,AccrInt] = cdprice(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate) computes
the price of a certificate of deposit given its yield.

cdprice assumes that the certificates of deposit pay interest at maturity. Because of the simple
interest treatment of these securities, this function is best used for short-term maturities (less than 1
year). The default simple interest calculation uses the Basis for the actual/360 convention (2).

[PriceAccrInt] = cdprice( ___ ,Basis) adds an optional argument for Basis.

Examples

Compute the Price and Accrued Interest for a Certificate of Deposit

This example shows how to compute the price and the accrued interest due on the settlement date,
given a certificate of deposit with the following characteristics.

Yield           =  0.0525;
CouponRate      =  0.05;
Settle          =  '02-Jan-02';
Maturity        =  '31-Mar-02';
IssueDate       =  '1-Oct-01';

[Price, AccruedInt] = cdprice(Yield, CouponRate, Settle, ... 
Maturity, IssueDate)

Price = 
99.9233

AccruedInt = 
1.2917
