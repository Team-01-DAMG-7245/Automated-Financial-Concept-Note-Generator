ᵞ is the continuous risk-free rate.

q is the continuous dividend yield.

J is the random percentage jump size conditional on the jump occurring, where

ln(1 + J) N(ln(1+uj) −δ2

2 , δ2

(1+J) has a lognormal distribution:

1
(1 + J)δ 2πexp

−ln(1 + J) −(ln(1+μj) −δ2

2

2

2δ2

Here:

μj is the mean of J(μj > -1).

ƛp is the annual frequency (intensity) of the Poisson process Pt (ƛp ≥ 0).

υ is the initial variance of the underlying asset (υ0 > 0).

θ is the long-term variance level (θ > 0).

κ is the mean reversion speed for the variance (κ > 0).

συ is the volatility of volatility (συ > 0).

p is the correlation between the Wiener processes Wt and Wt
υ (-1 ≤ p ≤ 1).

The "Feller condition" ensures positive variance: (2κθ > συ
2).

The stochastic volatility along with the jump help better model the asymmetric leptokurtic features,
the volatility smile, and the large random fluctuations such as crashes and rallies.
