In the context of the Black-Litterman model, posterior ∝likelihood * prior is expressed as f μ q ∝

f q μ *f μ , where each Bayesian term is defined as follows [2 on page 4-229]:

•
The likelihood is how likely it is for the views to happen given μ and is expressed as

f q μ ∝exp −1
2 Pμ −q ′Ω−1 Pμ −q
.

•
The prior assumes the prior knowledge that μ N π, C  and is expressed as f μ

∝exp −1
2 μ −π ′C−1 μ −π
.

•
The posterior is the distribution of μ given views and is expressed as

f μ q
∝exp −1
2 Pμ −q ′Ω−1 Pμ −q −1
2 μ −π ′C−1 μ −π
.

As previously stated, the posterior distribution of μ is also a normal distribution. By completing the
squares, you can derive the posterior mean and covariance as

μ−= PTΩ−1P + C−1 −1 PTΩ−1q + C−1π , cov μ = PTΩ−1P + C−1 −1.

Finally, by combining the Bayesian posterior distribution of μ and the model of asset returns
r
N μ, Σ , you then have the posterior prediction of asset returns as r
N μ−, Σ + cov μ .
