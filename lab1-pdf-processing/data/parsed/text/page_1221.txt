distributions of the simulated and true state vectors are identical only for piecewise constant
parameters. If S t, Xt , L t, Xt , and V t, Xt  are piecewise constant over each observation period, the
state vector Xtis normally distributed, and the simulated process is exact for the observation times at
which Xtis sampled.

Hull-White vs. Vasicek Models

Many references differentiate between Vasicek models and Hull-White models. Where such
distinctions are made, Vasicek parameters are constrained to be constants, while Hull-White
parameters vary deterministically with time. Think of Vasicek models in this context as constant-
coefficient Hull-White models and equivalently, Hull-White models as time-varying Vasicek models.
However, from an architectural perspective, the distinction between static and dynamic parameters is
trivial. Since both models share the same general parametric specification as previously described, a
single hwv object encompasses the models.

Creating Heston Stochastic Volatility Models

The Heston (heston) object derives directly from SDE from the Drift and Diffusion (sdeddo) class.
Each Heston model is a bivariate composite model, consisting of two coupled univariate models:

dX1t = B(t)X1tdt +
X2tX1tdW1t
 (14-5)

dX2t = S(t)[L(t) âˆ’X2t]dt + V(t) X2tdW2t
 (14-6)

The first equation is typically associated with a price process. The second equation represents the
evolution of the price process' variance. Models of type heston are typically used to price equity
options.

Specify Heston Stochastic Volatility Model

Create a heston object using heston to represent the model:

obj = heston (0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05)

obj =
