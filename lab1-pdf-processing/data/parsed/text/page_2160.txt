To support existing code, disc2zero also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: datetime | string | char

Settle — Common settlement date for discount rates in DiscRates
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector | serial date number

Common settlement date for the discount rates in DiscRates, specified as scalar datetime, string, or
date character vector.

To support existing code, disc2zero also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: datetime | string | char

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [ZeroRates,CurveDates] =
disc2zero(DiscRates,CurveDates,Settle,'Compounding',6,'Basis',9)

Compounding — Rate at which output zero rates are compounded when annualized
2 (default) | numeric values: 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 365, -1

Rate at which the output zero rates are compounded when annualized, specified as a numeric value.
Allowed values are:

•
0 — Simple interest (no compounding)

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding (default)

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

•
365 — Daily compounding

•
-1 — Continuous compounding

Data Types: double

Basis — Day-count basis used for annualizing output zero rates
0 (default) | numeric values: 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Day-count basis used for annualizing the output zero rates, specified as a numeric value. Allowed
values are:

•
0 = actual/actual
