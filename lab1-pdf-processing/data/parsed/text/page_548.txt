Specify the initial wealth.

initialWealth = 100;

Specify the target wealth at the end of the investment horizon.

targetWealth = 200;

Specify a time horizon.

finalTimePeriod = 10;

Define the mean and covariance of the annual returns.

returnMean = [0.05; 0.1; 0.25];
returnCovariance = [0.0025  0       0     ;
                    0       0.04    0.02  ;
                    0       0.02    0.25  ];

To solve the problem using RL, you need to define:

•
Actions on page 4-380 — Portfolio weights for investment portfolio.

•
Observations on page 4-381 — Time period t and wealth at time period t.

•
Environment on page 4-382 — Model of the evolution of the problem. The environment simulates
the next observation after receiving an action and computes its associated reward.

•
Reward on page 4-383 — Part of the environment that measures how well the received action
contributes to achieving the task.

•
Agent on page 4-384 — Component trained to complete the task within the environment. The
agent is responsible for choosing the actions required to complete the task.

Define Actions

The action at each rebalancing period is to choose the weights of the investment portfolio for the next
time period. In this example, assume that the possible portfolio weights are those of portfolios on the
efficient frontier. Also, you can assume that the choice of possible portfolios is fixed throughout the
full investment period and that they represent a finite subset of the efficient portfolios. By avoiding
working with a set of continuous actions in this way, you simplify the training and easily account for
the constraints on the portfolio weights (for example, that they sum to 1). However, you do have to
assume that the distribution of the returns is time-homogeneous; that is, the underlying mean and
covariance of the returns is the same at every time period.

Start by creating a Portfolio object with the asset information from the Problem Definition on page
4-379.

p = Portfolio(AssetMean=returnMean,AssetCovar=returnCovariance);

Add constraints to the portfolio problem. Use setBounds to bound the portfolio weights. Individual
assets cannot represent more than 50% of the portfolio wealth and shorting is not allowed.

p = setBounds(p,0,0.5);

Use setBudget to specify that the portfolio must be fully invested.

p = setBudget(p,1,1);
