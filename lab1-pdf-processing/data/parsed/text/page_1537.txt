Instance Hierarchy

There are inheritance relationships among the SDE classes.

The following figure illustrates the inheritance relationships.

For more information, see “SDE Models” on page 14-7, “SDE Classes and Associated Simulation
Methods” on page 14-13, and “SDE Class Hierarchy” on page 14-5.

volatility of the underlying asset is not constant but varies over time and is not necessarily correlated
with the asset price.
