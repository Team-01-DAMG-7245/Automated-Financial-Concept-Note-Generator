Output Arguments

qx — Conditional probabilities of dying for N ages and num series
matrix

Conditional probabilities of dying for N ages and num series, returned as an N-by-num matrix. The
series qx is the conditional probability that a person at age x will die between age x and the next age
in the series. For the last age, qx represents probabilities or counts for all ages after the last age.

The last row of the N-by-num output for qx is the values for all ages on or after the last age in x (due
to “Forced Termination” on page 15-1160). Therefore, the last row of qx contains 1 (100% probability
of dying on or after the last age).

lx — Survival counts for N ages and num series
matrix

Survival counts for N ages and num series, returned as an N-by-num matrix. The series lx is the
number of people alive at age x, given 100,000 alive at birth.
