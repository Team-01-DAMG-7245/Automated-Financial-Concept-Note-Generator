Simulation — A simulation function or method

Input Arguments

A — A represents the parameter A
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

A represents the parameter A, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify A as an array, it must be an NVars-by-1 column vector of intercepts.

As a deterministic function of time, when A is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only input,
A must produce an NVars-by-1 column vector. If you specify A as a function of time and state, it must
generate an NVars-by-1 column vector of intercepts when invoked with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function_handle

B — B represents the parameter B
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

B represents the parameter B, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify A as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NVars matrix of state vector coefficients.

As a deterministic function of time, when B is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only input,
B must produce an NVars-by-NVars matrix. If you specify B as a function of time and state, it must
generate an NVars-by-NVars matrix of state vector coefficients when invoked with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Alpha — Alpha represents the parameter D
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Alpha represents the parameter D, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.
