Bootstrapping from Inverted Market Curves

The following two examples demonstrate the behavior of bootstrapping with inverted CDS market
curves, that is, market quotes with higher spreads for short-term CDS contracts. The first example is
handled normally by cdsbootstrap:

Settle = '17-Jul-2009';  % valuation date for the CDS
MarketDates = datenum({'20-Sep-10','20-Sep-11','20-Sep-12','20-Sep-14',...
'20-Sep-16'});

ZeroDates = datenum({'17-Jan-10','17-Jul-10','17-Jul-11','17-Jul-12',...
'17-Jul-13','17-Jul-14'});
ZeroRates = [1.35 1.43 1.9 2.47 2.936 3.311]'/100;
ZeroData = [ZeroDates ZeroRates];

MarketSpreadsInv1 = [750 650 550 500 450]';
MarketDataInv1 = [MarketDates MarketSpreadsInv1];
[ProbDataInv1,HazDataInv1] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketDataInv1,Settle)

ProbDataInv1 =

1.0e+05 *

7.3440    0.0000
    7.3477    0.0000
    7.3513    0.0000
    7.3586    0.0000
    7.3659    0.0000

HazDataInv1 =

1.0e+05 *

7.3440    0.0000
    7.3477    0.0000
    7.3513    0.0000
    7.3586    0.0000
    7.3659    0.0000

In the second example, cdsbootstrap generates a warning:

MarketSpreadsInv2 = [800 550 400 250 100]';
MarketDataInv2 = [MarketDates MarketSpreadsInv2];

[ProbDataInv2,HazDataInv2] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketDataInv2,Settle);

Warning: Found non-monotone default probabilities (negative hazard rates)

A non-monotone bootstrapped probability curve implies negative default probabilities and negative
hazard rates for certain time intervals. Extreme market conditions can lead to these types of
situations. In these cases, you must assess the reliability and usefulness of the bootstrapped results.

The following plot illustrates these bootstrapped probability curves. The curves are concave, meaning
that the marginal default probability decreases with time. This result is consistent with the market
information that indicates a higher default risk in the short term. The second bootstrapped curve is
non-monotone, as indicated by the warning.

ProbTimes = yearfrac(Settle, MarketDates);
