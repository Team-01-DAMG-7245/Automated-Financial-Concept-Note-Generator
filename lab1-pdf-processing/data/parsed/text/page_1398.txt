Sigma — Sigma represents the parameter V
array or deterministic function of time

Sigma represents the parameter V, specified as an array or a deterministic function of time.

If you specify Sigma as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NBrowns two-dimensional matrix of
instantaneous volatility rates. In this case, each row of Sigma corresponds to a particular state
variable. Each column corresponds to a particular Brownian source of uncertainty, and associates the
magnitude of the exposure of state variables with sources of uncertainty.

As a deterministic function of time, when Sigma is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Sigma must produce an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix. If you specify Sigma as a function of time
and state, it must return an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix of volatility rates when invoked with two
inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Note Although diffusion enforces no restrictions on the signs of these volatility parameters, each
parameter is specified as a positive value.

Output Arguments

DiffusionRate — Diffusion rate model component
DiffusionRate object

Diffusion rate model component, returned as a DiffusionRate object.

Properties

Rate — Composite diffusion-rate function
value stored from diffusion-rate function (default) | function accessible by (t, Xt)

This property is read-only.

Composite diffusion-rate function, specified as: G(t,Xt)). The function stored in Rate fully
encapsulates the combined effect of Alpha and Sigma where:

•
Alpha is the state vector exponent, which determines the format of D(t,Xt) of G(t,Xt).

•
Sigma is the volatility rate, V(t,Xt), of G(t,Xt).
