Backtesting engine, returned as an updated backtestEngine object. After backtesting is complete,
runBacktest populates several properties in the backtestEngine object with the results of the
backtest. You can summarize the results by using the summary function.

runBacktest Processing Steps

runBacktest works in a walk-forward process.

The steps for runBacktest processing are:

1
runBacktest identifies the rebalancing time periods by using the RebalanceFrequency
property of the backtestStrategy object. For more information, see “Defining Schedules for
Backtest Strategies” on page 15-258.

2
At each rebalancing period, runBacktest decides if there is enough past data to perform the
rebalancing using the LookbackWindow property of the backtestStrategy object. For
example, if you are at rebalancing period T, the prices that are used are those at times t <= T, as
long as there is enough price data before time period T to satisfy the minimum value in the
LookbackWindow property. runBacktest also verifies that you are not using older data than
that defined by the maximum value in the LookbackWindow property.

3
The backtest information is computed at time T using the rebalanced weights and the prices at
time T.

4
Then runBacktest moves to time period T+1, where there are two options:

a
If T+1 is not a rebalancing time period, then the backtest information is computed using the
rebalancing at time T with the prices at time T+1.

b
If time T+1 is a rebalancing time period, then runBacktest proceeds to step 2 in this
process.

5
runBacktest continues running this process until the end of the backtest.

Version History
Introduced in R2020b

R2023b: Supports for CashAssets and DebtAssets name-value arguments

runBacktest supports name-value arguments for CashAssets and DebtAssets. When you specify
a CashAssets or DebtAssets using runBacktest, you can use the backtestStrategy
EngineDataList name-value argument to capture this backtest state data that a strategy needs in
the backtestStrategy rebalanceFcn input argument.
