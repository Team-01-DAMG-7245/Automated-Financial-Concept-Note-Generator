Overview

The base sde object

dXt = F(t, Xt)dt + G(t, Xt)dWt

represents the most general model.

Tip The sde class is not an abstract class. You can instantiate sde objects directly to extend the set
of core models.

Creating an sde object using sde requires the following inputs:

•
A drift-rate function F. This function returns an NVars-by-1 drift-rate vector when run with the
following inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

•
A diffusion-rate function G. This function returns an NVars-by-NBrowns diffusion-rate matrix when
run with the inputs t and Xt.

Evaluating object parameters by passing (t, Xt) to a common, published interface allows most
parameters to be referenced by a common input argument list that reinforces common method
programming. You can use this simple function evaluation approach to model or construct powerful
analytics, as in the following example.

Specify Base Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Model

Create an sde object using sde to represent a univariate geometric Brownian Motion model of the
form:

Create drift and diffusion functions that are accessible by the common (t, Xt) interface.

F = @(t,X) 0.1 * X;
G = @(t,X) 0.3 * X;

Pass the drift and diffusion functions to sde to creare an sde object.

obj = sde(F, G)    % dX = F(t,X)dt + G(t,X)dW

obj =
