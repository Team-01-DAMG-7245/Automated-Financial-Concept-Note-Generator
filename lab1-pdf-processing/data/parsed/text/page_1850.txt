bnddury

Bond duration given yield

Syntax

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddury(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,
Maturity)
[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddury( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddury(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,
Maturity) computes the Macaulay and modified duration of NUMBONDS fixed income securities
given yield to maturity for each bond.

bnddury determines the Macaulay and modified duration for a bond whether the first or last coupon
periods in the coupon structure are short or long (that is, whether the coupon structure is
synchronized to maturity). bnddury also determines the Macaulay and modified duration for a zero
coupon bond.

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddury( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional
name-value pair arguments.

Examples

Find Bond Duration Given Yield

This example shows how to compute the duration of a bond at three different yield values.

Yield = [0.04; 0.055; 0.06];  
CouponRate = 0.055; 
Settle = datetime(1999,8,2); 
Maturity = datetime(2004,6,15); 
Period = 2; 
Basis = 0;

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration]=bnddury(Yield,... 
CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis)

ModDuration = 3×1

4.2444
    4.1924
    4.1751

YearDuration = 3×1

4.3292
    4.3077
