Brinson Model

Performance attribution supports methods for single periods over relatively short time spans
(monthly) and multiple periods compounded over longer time spans (quarterly or a yearly).

The Brinson single-period sector-based (category-based) performance attribution is represented as:

rP, t = ∑
j = 1

N
wP j, trP j, t

rB, t = ∑
j = 1

N
wB j, trB j, t

rυ, t = rP, t −rB, t = ∑
j = 1

N
wP j, trP j, t −∑
j = 1

N
wB j, trB j, t

= ∑
j = 1

N
(wP j, t −wB j, t)(rB j, t −rB, t) + ∑
j = 1

N
(wP j, t −wB j, t)(rP j, t −rB j, t) + ∑
j = 1

N
wB j, t(rP j, t −rB j, t)

= ∑
j = 1

N
(Sj, t + Uj, t + Ij, t)

where

rP,t — Portfolio return for period t

rb,t — Benchmark return for period t

rυ,t — Value-added return for period t

N — Number of sectors

wPj,t — Portfolio weight for sector j and period t

rPj,t — Portfolio return for sector j and period t

wBj,t — Benchmark weight for sector j and period t

rBj,t — Benchmark return for sector j and period t

Sj,t — Sector allocation effect for sector j and period t

Uj,t — Allocation and sector interaction effect for sector j and period t

Ij,t — Issue sector effect for sector j and period t

Multiperiod performance attribution, uses two main styles of performance attribution: arithmetic and
geometric. In the arithmetic performance attribution, which is the method that the Brinson model
uses, the relative performance between the portfolio and benchmark is measured by subtracting the
benchmark return from the portfolio return. In the geometric performance attribution, the relative
