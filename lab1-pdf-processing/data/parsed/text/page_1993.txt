Irregular or normal first coupon date, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS
vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, cfdates also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Irregular or normal last coupon date

Irregular or normal last coupon date, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS
vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, cfdates also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Output Arguments

CFlowDates — Actual cash flow payment dates
matrix

Actual cash flow payment dates, returned as a N-row matrix of dates in datetime format (if inputs are
in datetime format). CFlowDates has NUMBONDS rows and the number of columns is determined by
the maximum number of cash flow payment dates required to hold the bond portfolio. NaNs are
padded for bonds which have less than the maximum number of cash flow payment dates.

If all of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, or LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then CFlowDates is returned as a serial date number. Use
the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, or LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then CFlowDates is returned as a datetime array.

Note The cash flow flags for a portfolio of bonds were formerly available as the cfdates second
output argument, CFlowFlags. You can now use cfamounts to get these flags. If you specify a
CFlowFlags argument, cfdates displays a message directing you to use cfamounts.
