Equally Weighted Portfolio

One of the diversification measures is the Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index defined as:

HH x = ∑
i = 1

n
xi
2

This index is minimized when the portfolio is equally weighted. The portfolios obtained from using
this index as a penalty have weights that satisfy the portfolio constraints and that are more evenly
weighted.

The portfolio that minimizes the HH index is min
x ∈X xTx. Since the constraints in X are the default

constraints, the solution of this problem is the equally weighted (EW) portfolio. If X had extra
constraints, the solution would be the portfolio that satisfies all the constraints and, at the same time,
keeps the weights as equal as possible. Use the function handle HHObjFun for the Herfindahl-
Hirschman (HH) index with the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function.

% Maximize the HH diversification (by minimizing the HH index).
HHObjFun = @(x) x'*x;
% Solution that minimizes the HH index
wHH = estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio(p,HHObjFun);

The portfolio that minimizes the variance with the HH penalty is min
x ∈X xTΣx + λHHxTx. Use the

function handle HHMixObjFun for the HH penalty with the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio
function.

% HH penalty parameter
lambdaHH = 1e-2;
% Variance + Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index
HHMixObjFun = @(x) x'*p.AssetCovar*x + lambdaHH*(x'*x);
% Solution that accounts for risk and HH diversification
wHHMix = estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio(p,HHMixObjFun);
