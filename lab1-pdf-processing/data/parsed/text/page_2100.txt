Settlement date, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector.

To support existing code, date2time also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date, specified as a scalar or N-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors.

To support existing code, date2time also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Compounding — Rate at which input zero rates are compounded when annualized
2 (Semiannual compounding) (default) | scalar with numeric values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 365, –1

Rate at which input zero rates are compounded when annualized, specified as a scalar with numeric
values of: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 365, or –1. Allowed values are defined as:

•
0 — Simple interest (no compounding)

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding (default)

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

•
365 — Daily compounding

•
-1 — Continuous compounding

The optional Compounding argument determines the formula for the discount factors (Disc):

•
Compounding = 0 for simple interest

•
Disc = 1/(1 + Z * T), where T is time in years and simple interest assumes annual times
F = 1.

•
Compounding = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

•
Disc = (1 + Z/F)^(-T), where F is the compounding frequency, Z is the zero rate, and T is
the time in periodic units, for example, T = F is one year.

•
Compounding = 365

•
Disc = (1 + Z/F)^(-T), where F is the number of days in the basis year and T is a number
of days elapsed computed by basis.

•
Compounding = -1

•
Disc = exp(-T*Z), where T is time in years.
