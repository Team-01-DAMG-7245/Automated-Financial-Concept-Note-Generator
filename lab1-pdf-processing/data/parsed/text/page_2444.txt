Indicate that Saturday is a business day by appropriately setting the Weekend argument. May 31,
2003, is a Saturday. Use lbusdate to check that this Saturday is actually the last business day of the
month.

Weekend = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0];
Date = lbusdate(2003, 5, [], Weekend,'datetime')

Date = datetime
   31-May-2003

Input Arguments

Year — Year to determine occurrence of weekday
4-digit integer | vector of 4-digit integers

Year to determine occurrence of weekday, specified as a 4-digit integer or vector of 4-digit integers.

Data Types: double

Month — Month to determine occurrence of weekday
integer with value 1 through 12 | vector of integers with values 1 through 12

Month to determine occurrence of weekday, specified as an integer or vector of integers with values 1
through 12.

Data Types: double

Holiday — Holidays and nontrading-day dates
non-trading day vector is determined by the routine holidays (default) | datetime array | string
array | date character vector

Holidays and nontrading-day dates, specified as a vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors.

All dates in Holiday must be the same format: either datetimes, strings, or date character vectors.
The holidays function supplies the default vector.

If Holiday is a datetime array, then Date is returned as a datetime array. If outputType is
specified, then its value determines the output type of Date. This overrides any influence of
Holiday.

To support existing code, lbusdate also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Weekend — Weekend days
[1 0 0 0 0 0 1] (Saturday and Sunday form the weekend) (default) | vector of length 7,
containing 0 and 1, where 1 indicates weekend days

Weekend days, specified as a vector of length 7, containing 0 and 1, where 1 indicates weekend days
and the first element of this vector corresponds to Sunday.

Data Types: double
