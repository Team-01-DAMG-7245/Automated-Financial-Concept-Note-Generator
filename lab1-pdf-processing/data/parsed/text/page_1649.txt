simByHybrid ignores QuasiSequence.

BrownianMotionMethod — Brownian motion construction method
"standard" (default) | string with value "brownian-bridge" or "principal-components" |
character vector with value 'brownian-bridge' or 'principal-components'

Brownian motion construction method, specified as a string or character vector with one of the
following values:

•
"standard" — The Brownian motion path is found by taking the cumulative sum of the Gaussian
variates.

•
"brownian-bridge" — The last step of the Brownian motion path is calculated first, followed by
any order between steps until all steps have been determined.

•
"principal-components" — The Brownian motion path is calculated by minimizing the
approximation error.

Note If an input noise process is specified using the Z input argument, BrownianMotionMethod is
ignored.

The starting point for a Monte Carlo simulation is the construction of a Brownian motion sample path
(or Wiener path). Such paths are built from a set of independent Gaussian variates, using either
standard discretization, Brownian-bridge construction, or principal components construction.

Both standard discretization and Brownian-bridge construction share the same variance and,
therefore, the same resulting convergence when used with the MonteCarloMethod using pseudo
random numbers. However, the performance differs between the two when the MonteCarloMethod
option "quasi" is introduced, with faster convergence for the "brownian-bridge" construction
option and the fastest convergence for the "principal-components" construction option.

Z — Direct specification of the dependent random noise process used to generate Brownian
motion vector
Correlated Gaussian variates generated by Correlation of rvm or roughbergomi model (default) |
numeric array

Direct specification of the dependent random noise process used to generate the Brownian motion
vector (Wiener process) that drives the simulation. This argument is specified as a function or as an
(NPeriods ⨉ NSteps)-by-NBrowns-by-NTrials three-dimensional array of dependent random
variates.

Data Types: double

StorePaths — Flag that indicates how output array Paths is stored and returned
True (default) | logical with values True or False

Flag that indicates how the output array Paths is stored and returned, specified as a scalar logical
flag with a value of True or False.
