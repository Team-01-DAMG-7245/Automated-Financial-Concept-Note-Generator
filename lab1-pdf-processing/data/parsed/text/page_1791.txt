blsdelta

Black-Scholes sensitivity to underlying price change

Syntax

[CallDelta,PutDelta] = blsdelta(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
[CallDelta,PutDelta] = blsdelta( ___ ,Yield)

Description

[CallDelta,PutDelta] = blsdelta(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns delta,
the sensitivity in option value to change in the underlying asset price. Delta is also known as the
hedge ratio. blsdelta uses normcdf, the normal cumulative distribution function in the Statistics
and Machine Learning Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and delta values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blsdelta can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

[CallDelta,PutDelta] = blsdelta( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Find the Sensitivity in Option Value to Change in the Underlying Asset Price

This example shows how to find the Black-Scholes delta sensitivity for an underlying asset price
change.

[CallDelta, PutDelta] = blsdelta(50, 50, 0.1, 0.25, 0.3, 0)

CallDelta = 
0.5955

PutDelta = 
-0.4045
