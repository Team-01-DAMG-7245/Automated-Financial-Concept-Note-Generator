Input Arguments

SpotInfo — Spot-rates information
matrix | table | term structure

Spot-rates information, specified as matrix of two columns, an annualized term structure created by
intenvset, or a table.

•
Matrix of two columns— The first column is the SpotDate, and the second column, ZeroRates, is
the zero-rate corresponding to maturities on the SpotDate. It is recommended that the spot-rates
are spaced as evenly apart as possible, perhaps one that is built from 3-months deposit rates. For
example, using the 3-month deposit rates:

SpotInfo = ...
[datenum('2-Jan-2004') ,  0.03840;
datenum('2-Jan-2005') ,  0.04512;
datenum('2-Jan-2006') ,  0.05086];
•
Annualized term structure — Refer to intenvset to create an annualized term structure. For
example:

Settle = datetime(2004,1,1);
Rates = [0.03840; 0.04512; 0.05086];
EndDates = [datetime(2004,1,2) datenum('2-Jan-2004'); datetime(2005,1,2);...
             datetime(2006,1,2)];
SpotInfo = intenvset('StartDates' , Settle  ,...
                      'Rates'      , Rates   ,...
                      'EndDates'   , EndDates,...
                      'Compounding', 2       ,...
                      'Basis'      , 0);
•
Table — If SpotInfo is a table, the first column can be either a datetime array, string array, or
date character vector. The second column is numerical data representing zero rates. For example:
