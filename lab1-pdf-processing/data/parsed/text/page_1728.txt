Note, when using abs2active to compute “active constraints” for use with a Portfolio object,
don't use the Portfolio object’s default constraints because the relative weights can be positive or
negative (the setDefaultConstraints function for a Portfolio object specifies weights to be
nonnegative).

Input Arguments

AbsConSet — Portfolio linear inequality constraint matrix expressed in absolute weight
format
matrix

Portfolio linear inequality constraint matrix expressed in absolute weight format, specified as [A b]
such that A*w <= b, where A is a number of constraints (NCONSTRAINTS) by number of assets
(NASSETS) weight coefficient matrix, and b and w are column vectors of length NASSETS. The value w
represents a vector of absolute asset weights whose elements sum to the total portfolio value. See the
output ConSet from portcons for additional details about constraint matrices.

Data Types: double

Index — Index portfolio weights
vector

Index portfolio weights, specified as a NASSETS-by-1 vector. The sum of the index weights must equal
the total portfolio value (for example, a standard portfolio optimization imposes a sum-to-1 budget
constraint).
