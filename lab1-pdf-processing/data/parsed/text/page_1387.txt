cir

Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) mean-reverting square root diffusion model

Description

Creates and displays a cir objects, which derives from the sdemrd (SDE with drift rate expressed in
mean-reverting form) class.

Use cir objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables expressed in mean-reverting drift-
rate form. These state variables are driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over
NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time CIR stochastic processes
with square root diffusions.

You can simulate any vector-valued CIR process of the form:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + D(t, Xt

1
2)V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean reversion speeds (the rate of mean reversion).

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels (long-run mean or level).

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
square root of the corresponding element of the state vector.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Syntax

CIR = cir(Speed,Level,Sigma)
CIR = cir( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

CIR = cir(Speed,Level,Sigma) creates a default CIR object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.
