getGroups

Obtain group constraint arrays from portfolio object

Syntax

[GroupMatrix,LowerGroup,UpperGroup] = getGroups(obj)

Description

Use the getGroups function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain group constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[GroupMatrix,LowerGroup,UpperGroup] = getGroups(obj) obtains group constraint arrays
from portfolio objects.

Examples

Obtain Group Constraints for a Portfolio Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets
constitute no more than 30% of your portfolio. Given a Portfolio object p with the group constraints
set, obtain the values for GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, and UpperGroup.

G = [ true true true false false ];
p = Portfolio;
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
[GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, UpperGroup] = getGroups(p)

GroupMatrix = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

LowerGroup =

[]

UpperGroup = 
0.3000
