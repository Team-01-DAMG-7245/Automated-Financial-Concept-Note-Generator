The Name property appears as the title of the efficient frontier plot if you set it in the
PortfolioCVaR object. Without an explicit name, the title on the plot would be "Efficient Frontier."
If you want to obtain a specific number of portfolios along the efficient frontier, use plotFrontier
with the number of portfolios that you want.

Suppose that you have this PortfolioCVaR object and you want to plot 20 portfolios along the
efficient frontier and to obtain 20 risk and return values for each portfolio:

[prsk, pret] = plotFrontier(p, 20);
