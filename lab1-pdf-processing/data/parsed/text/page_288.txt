The problem is
formulated by
introducing
NumAssets binary
variables to
indicate whether
the corresponding
asset is invested or
not. Therefore, it
requires a mixed
integer nonlinear
programming
solver. Three types
of MINLP solvers
are offered, see
setSolverMINLP.

Mixed integer
nonlinear
programming
solver (MINLP)
using
setSolverMINLP

'intlinprog' is
used when the
problem reduces to
a mixed-integer
linear problem.
This solver can be
configured using
setSolverMINLP
and its name-value
argument
IntMainSolverO
ptions.
