Cash Flow Duration

Cash flow duration is a measure used in finance to assess the sensitivity of the present value of an
investment's cash flows to changes in interest rates.

A higher cash flow duration indicates that the cash flows are received further in the future, making
the investment more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Conversely, a lower cash flow duration
suggests that cash flows are received sooner, resulting in less sensitivity to interest-rate changes.
