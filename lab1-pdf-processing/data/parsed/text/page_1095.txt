The Alpha column contains alpha estimates for each stock that are near zero as expected. In
addition, the t-statistics (which are enclosed in parentheses) generally reject the hypothesis that the
alphas are nonzero at the 99.5% level of significance.

The Beta column contains beta estimates for each stock that also have t-statistics enclosed in
parentheses. For all stocks but GOOG, the hypothesis that the betas are nonzero is accepted at the
99.5% level of significance. It would seem, however, that GOOG does not have enough data to obtain
a meaningful estimate for beta since its t-statistic would imply rejection of the hypothesis of a
nonzero beta.

The Sigma column contains residual standard deviations, that is, estimates for non-systematic risks.
Instead of t-statistics, the associated standard errors for the residual standard deviations are
enclosed in parentheses.

Grouped Estimation of Some Technology Stock Betas

To estimate stock betas for all twelve stocks, set up a joint regression model that groups all twelve
stocks within a single design (since each stock has the same design matrix, this model is actually an
example of seemingly-unrelated regression). The function to estimate model parameters is
ecmmvnrmle and the function to estimate standard errors is ecmmvnrstd.

Since GOOG has a significant number of missing values, a direct use of the missing data function
ecmmvnrmle takes 482 iterations to converge. This can take a long time to compute. For the sake of
brevity, the parameter and covariance estimates after the first 480 iterations are contained in a MAT-
file (CAPMgroupparam) and is used as initial estimates to compute stock betas.

Now estimate the parameters for the collection of twelve stocks.

NumParams = 2 * NumAssets;

% Set up the grouped asset data and design matrices.
TestData = zeros(NumSamples, NumAssets);
TestDesign = cell(NumSamples, 1);
Design = zeros(NumAssets, NumParams);

for    k = 1:NumSamples
    for i = 1:NumAssets
        TestData(k,i) = Data(k,i) - Data(k,14);
        Design(i,2*i - 1) = 1.0;
        Design(i,2*i) = Data(k,13) - Data(k,14);
    end
    TestDesign{k} = Design;
