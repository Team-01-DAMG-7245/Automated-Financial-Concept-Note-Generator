Mean-reversion speed of the stochastic variance process, returned as an array or deterministic
function of time.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Level — Reversion level or long-run average of stochastic variance process
array or deterministic function of time

Reversion level or long-run average of the stochastic variance process, returned as an array or
deterministic function of time.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Volatility — Instantaneous volatility of stochastic variance process
scalar or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous volatility of the stochastic variance process (often called the volatility of volatility or
volatility of variance), returned as a scalar or deterministic function of time.

Examples

Create roughheston Object

The roughheston object is a bivariate composite model, composed of two coupled and dissimilar
univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian motion source of risk over NPERIODS
consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time rough Heston stochastic volatility
processes.

Create a roughheston object.

Return = 0.1;
Speed = 0.2;
Level = 0.1;
Volatility = 0.05;
Alpha = -0.03;

roughHestonObj = roughheston(Return,Speed,Level,Volatility,Alpha)
