The samples from this distribution reflect the pattern of missing and nonmissing values for
observations k = 1, ..., m. You must sample from conditional distributions for each observation to
preserve the correlation structure with the nonmissing values at each observation.

If you follow this procedure, the resultant filled-in values are random and generate mean and
covariance estimates that are asymptotically equivalent to the ECM-derived mean and covariance
estimates. Note, however, that the filled-in values are random and reflect likely samples from the
distribution estimated over all the data and may not reflect “true” values for a particular observation.
