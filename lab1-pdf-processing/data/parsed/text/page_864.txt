Estimate Efficient Portfolios Along the Entire Frontier for
PortfolioMAD Object

There are two ways to look at a portfolio optimization problem that depends on what you are trying to
do. One goal is to estimate efficient portfolios and the other is to estimate efficient frontiers. The
“Obtaining Portfolios Along the Entire Efficient Frontier” on page 6-85 example focuses on the
former goal and “Estimate Efficient Frontiers for PortfolioMAD Object” on page 6-105 focuses on the
latter goal. For information on the workflow when using PortfolioMAD objects, see “PortfolioMAD
Object Workflow” on page 6-16.
