Use Estimated Volatility to Perform Factor Analysis on Commodities

Applying factor analysis is another technique for grouping the commodities into clusters, based on
the estimated volatility profiles.

Factor analysis assumes the existence of a certain number of hidden or latent factors underlying the
data. If you hypothesize that the volatility in the soft commodities is driven by a smaller number of
latent factors (such as external market conditions), then factor analysis provides one approach for
understanding these hidden factors. For more information on factor analysis, see factoran.

numLatentFactors = 3;
loadings = factoran( InferredVolatility.Variables, numLatentFactors );

Visualize the factor loadings by using heatmap.
