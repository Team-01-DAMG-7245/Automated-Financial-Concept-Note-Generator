Each row of G identifies which assets belong to a group associated with that row. Each row contains
either 0s or 1s with 1 indicating that an asset is part of the group or 0 indicating that the asset is not
part of the group.

PortfolioCVaR object properties to specify group constraints are:

•
GroupMatrix for G

•
LowerGroup for lG
•
UpperGroup for uG
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore these constraints.

Group Ratio Constraints

Group ratio constraints are specialized linear constraints that enforce relationships among groups of
assets. The constraints take the form

lRi(GBx)i ≤(GAx)i ≤uRi(GBx)i

for i = 1,..., nR where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

lR is the vector of lower-bound group ratio constraints (nR vector).

uR is the vector matrix of upper-bound group ratio constraints (nR vector).

GA is the matrix of base group membership indexes (nR-by-n matrix).

GB is the matrix of comparison group membership indexes (nR-by-n matrix).

n is the number of assets in the universe and nR is the number of constraints.

Each row of GA and GB identifies which assets belong to a base and comparison group associated with
that row.

Each row contains either 0s or 1s with 1 indicating that an asset is part of the group or 0 indicating
that the asset is not part of the group.

PortfolioCVaR object properties to specify group ratio constraints are:

•
GroupA for GA
•
GroupB for GB
•
LowerRatio for lR
•
UpperRatio for uR
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore these constraints.
