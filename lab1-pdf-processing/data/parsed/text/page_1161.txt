Heteroskedasticity refers to the changing variance of a variable over time. The sample ACF of the
squared returns shows the degree of persistence in variance.

To remove autocorrelation from the equity index return data, you can apply the ARIMA model by
using arima (Econometrics Toolbox). ARIMA models are widely used to capture the autocorrelation
