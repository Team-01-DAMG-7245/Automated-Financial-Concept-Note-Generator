ecmmvnrstd
Estimate standard errors of model and covariance parameters.

ecmmvnrfish
Estimate the Fisher information matrix.

Multivariate Normal Parameter Estimation With Missing Data

You can use the following functions to estimate the mean and covariance of multivariate normal data.

ecmnmle
Estimate the mean and covariance of the data.

ecmnstd
Estimate standard errors of the mean and covariance of the data.

ecmnfish
Estimate the Fisher information matrix.

ecmnhess
Estimate the Fisher information matrix using the Hessian.

ecmnobj
Calculate the log-likelihood function.

These functions behave slightly differently from the more general regression functions since they
solve a specialized problem. Consult the function reference pages for details.

Support Functions

Two support functions are included.

convert2sur
Convert a multivariate normal regression model into an SUR
model.

ecmninit
Obtain initial estimates for the mean and covariance of a Data
matrix.

The convert2sur function converts a multivariate normal regression model into a seemingly
unrelated regression, or SUR, model. The second function ecmninit is a specialized function to
obtain initial ad hoc estimates for the mean and covariance of a Data matrix with missing data. (If
there are no missing values, the estimates are the maximum likelihood estimates for the mean and
covariance.)
