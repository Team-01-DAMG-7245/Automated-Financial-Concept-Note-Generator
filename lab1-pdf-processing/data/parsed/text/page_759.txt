Since mean-variance and CVaR are two different risk measures, this example illustrates that the
efficient portfolio for one type of risk measure is not efficient for the other.

CVaR and Mean-Variance Portfolio Weights Comparison

Examine the portfolio weights of the portfolios that make up each efficient frontier to obtain a more
detailed comparison between the mean-variance and CVaR efficient frontiers.

Plot the weights associated with the mean-variance portfolio efficient frontier.
