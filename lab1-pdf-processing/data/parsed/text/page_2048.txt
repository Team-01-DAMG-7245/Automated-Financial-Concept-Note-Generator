Output Arguments

DesignSUR — Seemingly unrelated regression model with a specified grouping of the data
series
matrix | cell array

Seemingly unrelated regression model with a specified grouping of the data series, returned as either
a matrix or a cell array that depends on the value of NUMSERIES.

•
If NUMSERIES = 1, DesignSUR = Design, which is a NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix.

•
If NUMSERIES > 1 and NUMGROUPS groups are to be formed, Design is a cell array with
NUMSAMPLES cells, where each cell contains a NUMSERIES-by-(NUMGROUPS * NUMPARAMS)
matrix of known values.

The original collection of parameters that are common to all series are replicated to form collections
of parameters for each group.

More About

Multivariate Normal Regression

Multivariate normal regression is a statistical modeling approach that extends traditional regression
techniques to situations where the dependent variable is multivariate, meaning it consists of multiple
correlated outcomes.

Multivariate normal regression is particularly useful in fields where researchers are interested in
understanding the relationships between several response variables and one or more predictor
variables.

Seemingly Unrelated Regression Model

The Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model is a statistical method used in econometrics to
estimate multiple regression equations that are related to each other through their error terms.

The SUR model allows for the simultaneous estimation of these equations, taking into account the
potential correlation between the error terms of different equations. This can lead to more efficient
estimates compared to estimating each equation independently.
