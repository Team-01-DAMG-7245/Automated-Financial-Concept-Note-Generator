The following figure shows the loss reserves balance for each of the three alternatives in the
backtesting exercise.

EAD = 100*ones(nYearsBT,1); % in billions
LGD = 0.45*ones(nYearsBT,1); % Loss given default, 45%
% Reserves excess or shortfall for each year, in billions
ReservesExcessShortfall = bsxfun(@times,EAD.*LGD,ErrorBT/100);
% Cumulative reserve balance for each year, in billions
ReservesBalanceEOY = cumsum(ReservesExcessShortfall);

Using the linear regression model you can only observe a deficit in reserves in two out of ten years,
and the maximum deficit, in 2001, is 0.09 billion, only nine basis points of the portfolio value.

In contrast, both TTC and PIT reach a deficit of 1.2 billion by 2001. Things get worse for TTC in the
next two years, reaching a deficit of 2.1 billion by 2003. PIT does make a correction quickly after
2001, and by 2004 the reserves have a surplus. Yet, both TTC and PIT lead to more deficit years than
surplus years in this exercise.

The linear regression model shows more of a counter-cyclical effect than the alternatives in this
exercise. The money set aside using the linear regression model reaches close to a billion in 1997 and
1998. High levels of unused reserves translate into a slower pace of lending (not reflected in this
example, because you exogenously impose the portfolio value). Moreover, capital is only slightly
impacted during the 2001 recession thanks to the reserves accumulated over the previous expansion.
This translates into more capital available to back up further lending, if desired, during the economic
recovery.
