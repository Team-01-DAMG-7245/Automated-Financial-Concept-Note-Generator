elpm

Compute expected lower partial moments for normal asset returns

Syntax

elpm(Mean,Sigma)
elpm(Mean,Sigma,MAR)
elpm(Mean,Sigma,MAR,Order)
Moment = elpm(MeanSigmaMAROrder)

Description

elpm(Mean,Sigma) compute expected lower partial moments (elpm) relative to a default value of
MAR for each asset in a NUMORDERS-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

elpm(Mean,Sigma,MAR) computes expected lower partial moments (elpm) relative to a MAR for
each asset in a NUMORDERS-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

elpm(Mean,Sigma,MAR,Order) computes expected lower partial moments (elpm) relative to a MAR
and Order for each asset in a NUMORDERS-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

Moment = elpm(MeanSigmaMAROrder) computes expected lower partial moments (elpm) relative
to a default value of MAR for each asset in a NUMORDERS-by-NUMSERIES matrix Moment.

Examples

Compute Expected Lower Partial Moments

This example shows how to compute expected lower partial moments based on the mean and
standard deviations of normally distributed asset returns. The elpm function works with the mean
and standard deviations for multiple assets and multiple orders.

load FundMarketCash
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
MAR = mean(Returns(:,3))

MAR = 
0.0017

Mean = mean(Returns)

Mean = 1×3

0.0038    0.0030    0.0017

Sigma = std(Returns, 1)

Sigma = 1×3
