As a deterministic function of time, Correlation allows you to specify a dynamic correlation
structure.

Data Types: double

Simulation — User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method
simulation by Euler approximation (simByEuler) (default) | function | SDE simulation method

User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method, specified as a function or SDE simulation
method. The default is an Euler approximation (simByEuler).

Data Types: function_handle

Output Arguments

RoughHeston — Rough Heston model
RoughHeston object

Rough Heston model, returned as a RoughHeston object.

Properties

StartTime — Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables
0 (default) | scalar

Starting time of the first observation, applied to all state variables, returned as a scalar.

Data Types: double

StartState — Initial values of state variables
1 (default) | scalar, column vector, or matrix

Initial values of the state variables, returned as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
2-by-2 identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) | positive semidefinite
matrix

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), returned as a scalar or positive semidefinite matrix.

Data Types: double

Return — Expected (mean) instantaneous rate of return of GBM price process
array, deterministic function of time, deterministic function of time and state

Expected (mean) instantaneous rate of return of the GBM price process, returned as an array, a
numeric scalar, or a deterministic function of time as a function handle, or as a function of time and
state.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Speed — Mean-reversion speed of stochastic variance process
array or deterministic function of time
