Hedging Using CVaR Portfolio Optimization

This example shows how to model two hedging strategies using CVaR portfolio optimization with a
PortfolioCVaR object. First, you simulate the price movements of a stock by using a gbm object
with simByEuler. Then you use CVaR portfolio optimization to estimate the efficient frontier of the
portfolios for the returns at the horizon date. Finally, you compare the CVaR portfolio to a mean-
variance portfolio to demonstrate the differences between these two types of risk measures.

Monte Carlo Simulation of Asset Scenarios

Scenarios are required to define and evaluate the CVaR portfolio. These scenarios can be generated
in multiple ways, as well as obtained from historical observations. This example uses a Monte Carlo
simulation of a geometric Brownian motion to generate the scenarios. The Monte Carlo simulation
produces trials of a stock price after one year. These stock prices provide the returns of five different
investment strategies that define the assets in the CVaR portfolio. This scenario generation strategy
can be further generalized to simulations with more stocks, instruments, and strategies.

Define a stock profile.

% Price at time 0
Price_0 = 200;

% Drift (annualized)
Drift = 0.08;

% Volatility (annualized)
Vol = 0.4;

% Valuation date
Valuation = datetime(2012,1,1);

% Investment horizon date
Horizon = datetime(2013,1,1);

% Risk-free rate
RiskFreeRate = 0.03;

Simulate the price movements of the stock from the valuation date to the horizon date using a gbm
object with simByEuler.

% Number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation
NTRIALS = 100000;

% Length (in years) of the simulation
T = date2time(Valuation, Horizon, 1, 1);

% Number of periods per trial (approximately 100 periods per year)
NPERIODS = round(100*T);

% Length (in years) of each time step per period
dt = T/NPERIODS;

% Instantiate the gbm object
StockGBM = gbm(Drift, Vol, 'StartState', Price_0);
