•
The set of feasible portfolios must be a nonempty compact set, where a compact set is closed and
bounded. You can satisfy this condition using an extensive collection of properties that define
different types of constraints to form a set of feasible portfolios. Since such sets must be bounded,
either explicit or implicit constraints can be imposed and several tools, such as the
estimateBounds function, provide ways to ensure that your problem is properly formulated.

•
You must specify a probability level to locate the level of tail loss above which the conditional
value-at-risk is to be minimized. This condition can be satisfied by the setProbabilityLevel
function.

Although the general sufficient conditions for CVaR portfolio optimization go beyond the first
three conditions, the PortfolioCVaR object handles all these additional conditions.

PortfolioCVaR Function Examples

If you create a PortfolioCVaR object, p, with no input arguments, you can display it using disp:

p = PortfolioCVaR;
disp(p)
