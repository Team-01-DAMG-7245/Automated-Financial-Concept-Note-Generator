Algorithms

The maximization of the Sharpe ratio is accomplished by either using the 'direct' or 'iterative'
method. For the 'direct' method, consider the following scenario. To maximize the Sharpe ratio is
to:

MaximizeμTx −rf

xTCx
, s . t . ∑xi = 1,   0 ≤xi ≤1,

where μ and C are the mean and covariance matrix, and rf is the risk-free rate.

If μT x - rf ≤ 0 for all x the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio is the one with maximum return.

If μT x - rf > 0, let t =
1
μTx −rf

and y = tx (Cornuejols [1] section 8.2). Then after some substitutions, you can transform the original
problem into the following form,

Minimize yTCy,  s . t .  ∑yi = t,  t > 0,  0 ≤yi ≤t , μTy −rft = 1.

Only one optimization needs to be solved, hence the name “direct”. The portfolio weights can be
recovered by x* = y* / t*.

For the 'iterative' method, the idea is to iteratively explore the portfolios at different return
levels on the efficient frontier and locate the one with maximum Sharpe ratio. Therefore, multiple
optimization problems are solved during the process, instead of only one in the 'direct' method.
Consequently, the 'iterative' method is slow compared to 'direct' method.
