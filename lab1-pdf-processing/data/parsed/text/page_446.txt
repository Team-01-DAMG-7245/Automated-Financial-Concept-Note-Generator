As expected, the ESG scores of the penalized strategies are better than the ESG scores of the
minimum variance portfolio without constraint and penalty terms. However, the tilted strategies
achieve lower ESG scores than the ones that include the target ESG score as a constraint. This
comparison shows the flexibility of the tilted strategy. If the ESG target score is not an essential
requirement, then you can consider a tilting strategy.

Backtest Using Strategies

To show the performance through time for the two strategies (Diversification for Fixed ESG Level on
page 4-274 and Diversification by "Tilting" on page 4-276), use the backtestEngine framework.
Use backtestStrategy to compare the strategies with a prespecified target ESG score with the
strategies that use ESG tilting.

% Store info to pass to ESG constrained strategies
Ain = -ESGnumeric';
bin = -ESG0; % Set the target ESG score.
conStruct.p = setInequality(p,-ESGnumeric',-ESG0);
conStruct.ret0 = ret0;

conStruct.lambdaHH =
;

conStruct.lambdaMDP =
;

% Store info to pass to ESG tilting strategies
tiltStruct.p = setInequality(p,[],[]);
tiltStruct.ret0 = ret0;
% HH tilting penalty parameters
% Penalty parameter for assets with 'low' ESG score

HHlambdaLow =
;
% Penalty parameter for assets with 'high' ESG score

HHlambdaHigh =
