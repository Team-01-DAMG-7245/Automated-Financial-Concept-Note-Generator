Portfolio Analysis with Turnover Constraints

This example shows how to analyze the characteristics of a portfolio of equities, and then compare
them with the efficient frontier. This example seeks to answer the question of how much closer can
you get to the efficient frontier by only risking a certain percentage of a portfolio to avoid transaction
costs.

Import Data for the Portfolio Holdings

Load information on the current portfolio holdings from a Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet into a
table using the MATLAB® readtable function.

AssetHoldingData = readtable('portfolio.xls');
% Create a normalized current holdings vector that shows the respective
% investments as a percentage of total capital:
W = AssetHoldingData.Value/sum(AssetHoldingData.Value);

Import Market Data for Share Prices

Import the market data from a data source supported by Datafeed Toolbox™ that constitutes three
years of closing prices for the stocks listed in the portfolio.

load SharePrices

Create a Portfolio Object

The Portfolio class enables you to use the imported data to create a Portfolio object. The 
estimateAssetMoments function for the Portfolio object enables you to set up a portfolio given
only a historical price or returns series. The estimateAssetMoments function estimates mean and
covariance of asset returns from data even if there is missing data.

P = Portfolio('Name', 'Sample Turnover Constraint Portfolio');
P = estimateAssetMoments(P,data,'DataFormat','Prices');

% You can assign text names to each asset in the portfolio.
P = setAssetList(P,AssetHoldingData.Symbol);

% Provide the current holdings.
P = setInitPort(P,W);

Perform Portfolio Optimization with No Turnover Constraint

The Portfolio object can optimize the holdings given any number of constraints. This example
demonstrates using a simple, default constraint, that is, long positions only and 100% invested in
assets.

P = setDefaultConstraints(P);

Visualize this efficient frontier with the plotFrontier function.
