blsimpv

Black-Scholes implied volatility

Syntax

Volatility = blsimpv(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Value)
Volatility = blsimpv( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Volatility = blsimpv(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Value) using a Black-Scholes model
computes the implied volatility of an underlying asset from the market value of European options. If
the Class name-value argument is empty or unspecified, the default is a call option

Note The input arguments Price, Strike, Rate, Time, Value, Yield, and Class can be scalars,
vectors, or matrices. If scalars, then that value is used to compute the implied volatility from all
options. If more than one of these inputs is a vector or matrix, then the dimensions of all non-scalar
inputs must be the same.

Also, ensure that Rate, Time, and Yield are expressed in consistent units of time.

Volatility = blsimpv( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more name-value pair
arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Compute the Implied Volatility of an Underlying Asset Using a Black-Scholes Model

This example shows how to compute the implied volatility for a European call option trading at $10
with an exercise price of $95 and three months until expiration. Assume that the underlying stock
pays no dividend and trades at $100. The risk-free rate is 7.5% per annum. Furthermore, assume that
you are interested in implied volatilities no greater than 0.5 (50% per annum). Under these
conditions, the following statements all compute an implied volatility of 0.3130, or 31.30% per
annum.

Volatility = blsimpv(100, 95, 0.075, 0.25, 10, 'Limit', 0.5);
Volatility = blsimpv(100, 95, 0.075, 0.25, 10, 'Limit',0.5,'Yield',0,'Class', {'Call'});
Volatility = blsimpv(100, 95, 0.075, 0.25, 10, 'Limit',0.5,'Yield',0, 'Class', true);
Volatility = blsimpv(100, 95, 0.075, 0.25, 10, 'Limit',0.5,'Yield',0, 'Class', true,'Method','jac

Volatility = 
0.3130
