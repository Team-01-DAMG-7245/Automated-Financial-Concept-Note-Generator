Note If the portfolio problem has cardinality constraints or conditional bounds specified using
setMinMaxNumAssets or setBounds, the objective function must also be convex.

Examples of Concave Functions

Here are some examples of common concave functions used in finance. You can use concave
functions in maximization problems when using a Portfolio object with the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function.

•
Risk penalized return:

μTx −λxTΣx,  λ ≥0

•
Any linear function

•
Any positive combination of concave functions

Examples of Nonconvex Functions

Here are some examples of common nonconvex functions used in finance. You can use nonconvex
functions in minimization or maximization problems when using a Portfolio object without
cardinality constraints or conditional bounds with the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio
function.

•
Sharpe ratio:

μTx −rf

xTΣx

•
Information ratio:

μT(x −x0)

(x −x0)TΣ(x −x0)

•
Diversification ratio:

σTx

xTΣx

•
Risk budgeting deviation:

∑
i

xi(Σx)i
xTΣx
−bi

2

•
The following function is a special case:

xTΣx −λ∑
i
lnxi

This function is commonly used to construct risk parity portfolios. Although this function is
convex, problems with cardinality constraints or conditional bounds make this function ill-defined.
This happens because lnxi is not defined when xi = 0. Since adding cardinality constraints or
conditional bounds imply that some assets have a weight of 0, the function becomes ill-defined at
the points of interest.
