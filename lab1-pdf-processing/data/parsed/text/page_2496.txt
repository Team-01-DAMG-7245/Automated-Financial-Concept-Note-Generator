If Design has a single cell, it is assumed to have the same Design matrix for each sample. If
Design has more than one cell, each cell contains a Design matrix for each sample.

Data Types: double | cell

Covariance — Estimates for the covariance of the residuals of the regression
matrix

Estimates for the covariance of the residuals of the regression, specified as an NUMSERIES-by-
NUMSERIES matrix.

Data Types: double

MatrixFormat — Parameters to be included in Fisher information matrix
'full' (default) | character vector with value 'full' or 'paramonly'

(Optional) Parameters to be included in the Fisher information matrix, specified as a character vector.
The choices are:

•
'full' — This is the default method that computes the full Fisher information matrix for both
model and covariance parameter estimates.

•
'paramonly' — This computes only components of the Fisher information matrix associated with
the model parameter estimates.

Data Types: char

CovarFormat — Format for covariance matrix
'full' (default) | character vector with value 'full' or 'diagonal'

(Optional) Format for the covariance matrix, specified as a character vector. The choices are:

•
'full' — This is the default method that computes the full covariance matrix.

•
'diagonal' — This forces the covariance matrix to be a diagonal matrix.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

Fisher — Fisher information matrix
matrix

Fisher information matrix, returned as an TOTALPARAMS-by-TOTALPARAMS matrix.

More About

Fisher Information Matrix

The Fisher information matrix is a key concept in statistics and information theory that measures the
amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter upon
which the probability of the random variable depends.

The Fisher information matrix is used to evaluate the efficiency of estimators and to derive
confidence intervals.
