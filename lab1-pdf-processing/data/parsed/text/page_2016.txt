Input Arguments

CFlowAmounts — Cash flow amounts
matrix

Cash flow amounts, specified as number of bonds (NUMBONDS) by number of cash flows (NUMCFS)
matrix with entries listing cash flow amounts corresponding to each date in CFlowDates.

Data Types: double

CFlowDates — Cash flow dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Cash flow dates, specified as an NUMBONDS-by-NUMCFS matrix with rows listing cash flow dates using
a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors for each bond and padded with NaNs. If
CFlowDates is a serial date number or a date character vector, AllDates is returned as an array of
serial date numbers. If CFlowDates is a datetime array, then AllDates is returned as a datetime
array.

To support existing code, cfport also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

TFactors — Time between settlement and the cash flow date
matrix

(Optional) Time between settlement and the cash flow date, specified as an NUMBONDS-by-NUMCFS
matrix with entries listing the time between settlement and the cash flow date measured in
semiannual coupon periods.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

CFBondDate — Cash flows indexed by bond and by date
matrix

Cash flows indexed by bond and by date, returned as an NUMBONDS by number of dates (NUMDATES)
matrix. Each row contains a bond's cash flow values at the indices corresponding to entries in
AllDates. Other indices in the row contain zeros.

AllDates — List of all dates that have any cash flow from the bond portfolio
matrix
