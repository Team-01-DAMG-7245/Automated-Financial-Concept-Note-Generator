covarianceShrinkage

Estimate covariance matrix using shrinkage estimators

Syntax

SigmaHat = covarianceShrinkage(AssetReturns)

Description

SigmaHat = covarianceShrinkage(AssetReturns) returns a covariance estimate using linear
shrinkage to reduce the mean squared error (MSE).

covarianceShrinkage computes an estimate of the covariance matrix from a sample of asset
returns using the multiple of the identity shrinkage estimation method. For more information, see
“Covariance Shrinkage” on page 15-62 and “covarianceShrinkage Algorithm” on page 15-62.

In addition, you can use covarianceDenoising to compute an estimate of covariance matrix using
denoising. For information on which covariance estimation method to choose, see “Comparison of
Methods for Covariance Estimation” on page 4-138.

Examples

Perform Covariance Linear Shrinkage

This example shows how to use covarianceShrinkage to compute covariance estimations that take
into account the noise in the sample. In mean-variance portfolio optimization, a noisy estimate of the
covariance estimate results in unstable solutions that cause high turnover and transaction costs.
Ideally, to decrease the estimation error, it is desirable to increase the sample size. Yet, there are
cases where this is not possible. In extreme cases in which the number of assets is larger than the
number of observations, the traditional covariance matrix results in a singular matrix. Working with a
nearly singular or an ill-conditioned covariance matrix magnifies the impact of estimation errors.

Compute a portfolio efficient frontier using different covariance estimates with the same sample data.

% Load portfolio data with 225 assets
load port5.mat
covariance = corr2cov(stdDev_return,Correlation);
% Generate a sample with 200 observations
rng('default')
nScen = 200;
retSeries = portsim(mean_return',covariance,nScen);

Compute the traditional and shrunk covariance estimates. Use covarianceShrinkage to reduce the
effect of noise in the covariance approximation.

Sigma = cov(retSeries);
shrunkSigma = covarianceShrinkage(retSeries);

Compute the condition number of both covariance estimates. The shrunken covariance
(shrunkSigma) has a lower condition number than the traditional covariance estimate Sigma.
