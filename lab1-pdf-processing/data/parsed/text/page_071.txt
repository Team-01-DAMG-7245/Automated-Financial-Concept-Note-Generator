PriceOnPurchaseDate = tbillprice(InitialDiscount, ... 
PurchaseDate, Maturity, 3)

PriceOnPurchaseDate = 
99.5930

Compute the interest due on the repurchase agreement.

RepoInterest = ... 
RepoRate*PriceOnPurchaseDate*days360(PurchaseDate,SaleDate)/360

RepoInterest = 
0.1237

RepoInterest for a 1.49% 30-day term repurchase agreement (30/360 basis) is 0.1237.

Compute the price of the Treasury bill on the sale date (October 26).

PriceOnSaleDate = tbillprice(BreakevenDiscount, SaleDate, ... 
Maturity, 3)

PriceOnSaleDate = 
99.7167

Examining the cash flows, observe that the break-even discount causes the sum of the price on the
purchase date plus the accrued 30-day interest to be equal to the price on sale date. The following
table shows the cash flows:

Treasury Bill Yields

This example shows how to convert a Treasury bill discount to an equivalent yield.

You can examine the money-market and bond-equivalent yields of a Treasury bill at the time of
purchase and sale. The function tbilldisc2yield can perform both computations at one time.

Maturity = '26-Dec-2002';
InitialDiscount = 0.0161;
PurchaseDate = '26-Sep-2002';
SaleDate = '26-Oct-2002';
RepoRate = 0.0149;
BreakevenDiscount = tbillrepo(RepoRate, InitialDiscount, ... 
PurchaseDate, SaleDate, Maturity)

BreakevenDiscount = 
0.0167
