Changing MINLP Solvers

In the previous section, you use the default solver for estimateFrontier. However, you can solve
mixed-integer portfolio problems using any of the three algorithms supported by setSolverMINLP:
OuterApproximation, ExtendedCP, and TrustRegionCP. Furthermore, the
OuterApproximation algorithm accepts an additional name-value argument
(ExtendedFormulation) for Portfolo problems, which reformulates problems with quadratic
functions to work in an extended space that usually decreases the computation time. All algorithms,
including the extended formulation variation of the OuterApproximation algorithm, return the
same values within numerical accuracy. The available solvers are:

•
OuterApproximation — The default algorithm, which is robust and usually faster than
ExtenedCP

•
OuterApproximation with ExtendedFormulation set to true — A robust algorithm that is
usually faster than other algorithms, but only supported for Portfolio object problems

•
ExtendedCP — The most robust solver, but usually the slowest

•
TrustRegionCP — The fastest algorithm, but one that is less robust and may provide suboptimal
solutions

For more information on solvers for mixed-integer portfolio problems, see “Choose MINLP Solvers for
Portfolio Problems” on page 4-140.

To change the MINLP solvers, use setSolverMINLP.

% Select the extended formulation version of 'OuterApproximation' as the
% solver.
p_EOA = setSolverMINLP(p,'OuterApproximation',...
    ExtendedFormulation=true);
pwgt_EOA = estimateFrontier(p_EOA);
[rskEOA,retEOA] = estimatePortMoments(p_EOA,pwgt_EOA);
