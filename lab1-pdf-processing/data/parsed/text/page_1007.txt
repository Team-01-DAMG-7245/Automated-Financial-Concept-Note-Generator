Finally, compute the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. Recall that the null hypothesis of the Hosmer-
Lemeshow test is that the actual (observed) and predicted (expected) probability of default is the
same. Thus, a small p-value that rejects the null hypothesis is an indicator of a poor model fit.

N = bads+goods;
obsBads = bads;
expBads = predPD.*N;
HLStatistic = sum((obsBads-expBads).^2./(N.*predPD.*(1-predPD)));
% 8 degrees of freedom = 10 (deciles) - 2
pHL = chi2cdf(HLStatistic,8,'upper')

pHL = 
0.8503
