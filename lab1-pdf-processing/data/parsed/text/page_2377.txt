Maturity dates, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors, that correspond to the ForwardRates.

To support existing code, fwd2zero also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: datetime | string | char

Settle — Common settlement date for ForwardRates
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Common settlement date for ForwardRates, specified as scalar datetime, string, or date character
vector.

To support existing code, fwd2zero also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: datetime | string | char

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [ZeroRates,CurveDates] =
fwd2zero(ForwardRates,CurveDates,Settle,'InputCompounding',3,'InputBasis',5,'
OutputCompounding',4,'OutputBasis',5)

InputCompounding — Compounding frequency of input forward rates
2 (default) | numeric values: 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 365, -1

Compounding frequency of input forward rates, specified with allowed values:

•
0 — Simple interest (no compounding)

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding (default)

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

•
365 — Daily compounding

•
-1 — Continuous compounding

Note If InputCompounding is not specified, then InputCompounding is assigned the value
specified for OutputCompounding. If either InputCompounding or OutputCompounding are not
specified, the default is 2

Data Types: double
