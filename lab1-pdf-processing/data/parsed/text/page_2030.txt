cftimes

Time factors corresponding to bond cash flow dates

Syntax

TFactors = cftimes(Settle,Maturity)
TFactors = cftimes( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

TFactors = cftimes(Settle,Maturity) determines the time factors corresponding to the cash
flows of a bond or set of bonds.

cftimes computes the time factor of a cash flow, which is the difference between the settlement date
and the cash flow date, in units of semiannual coupon periods. In computing time factors, use SIA
actual/actual day count conventions for all time factor calculations.

TFactors = cftimes( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more name-value pair
arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Compute the Time Factor of a Cash Flow

This example shows how to calculate a cash flow time factor.

Settle = datetime(1997,3,15);
Maturity = datetime(1999,9,1);
Period = 2;
TFactors = cftimes(Settle, Maturity, Period)

TFactors = 1×5

0.9239    1.9239    2.9239    3.9239    4.9239

Input Arguments

Settle — Settlement date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as an NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. Settle must be earlier than Maturity.

To support existing code, cftimes also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime
