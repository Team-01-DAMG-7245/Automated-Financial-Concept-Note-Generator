Combined Turnover and Tracking-Error Constraints

This example illustrates the interactions that can occur with combined constraints. In this case, both
a turnover constraint relative to an initial equal-weight portfolio and a tracking-error constraint
relative to a tracking portfolio must be satisfied. The turnover constraint has a maximum of 30%
turnover and the tracking-error constraint has a maximum of 5% tracking error. Note that the
turnover to get from the initial portfolio to the tracking portfolio is 70% so that an upper bound of
30% turnover means that the efficient frontier will lie somewhere between the initial portfolio and the
tracking portfolio.

Turnover = 0.3;
InitPort = (1/q.NumAssets)*ones(q.NumAssets, 1);

ii = [15, 16, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30];    % Indexes of assets to include in tracking portfoli

TrackingError = 0.05/sqrt(12);
TrackingPort = zeros(30, 1);
TrackingPort(ii) = 1;
TrackingPort = (1/sum(TrackingPort))*TrackingPort;
