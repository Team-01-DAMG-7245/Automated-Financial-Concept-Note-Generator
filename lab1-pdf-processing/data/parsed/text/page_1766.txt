Amortization schedule

Syntax

[Principal,Interest,Balance,Payment] = amortize(Rate,NumPeriods,PresentValue)
[Principal,Interest,Balance,Payment] = amortize( ___ ,FutureValue,Due)

Description

[Principal,Interest,Balance,Payment] = amortize(Rate,NumPeriods,PresentValue)
returns the principal and interest payments of a loan, the remaining balance of the original loan
amount, and the periodic payment.

[Principal,Interest,Balance,Payment] = amortize( ___ ,FutureValue,Due) specifies
options using one or more optional arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous
syntax.

Examples

Compute an Amortization Schedule for a Conventional 30-Year, Fixed-Rate Mortgage With
Fixed Monthly Payments

Compute an amortization schedule for a conventional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage with fixed monthly
payments and assume a fixed rate of 12% APR and an initial loan amount of $100,000.

Rate         = 0.12/12;   % 12 percent APR = 1 percent per month
NumPeriods   = 30*12;     % 30 years = 360 months
PresentValue = 100000;

[Principal, Interest, Balance, Payment] = amortize(Rate, ...
NumPeriods, PresentValue);

The output argument Payment contains the fixed monthly payment.

Summarize the amortization schedule graphically by plotting the current outstanding loan balance,
the cumulative principal, and the interest payments over the life of the mortgage. In particular, note
that total interest paid over the life of the mortgage exceeds $270,000, far in excess of the original
loan amount.
