If you bin the weighted data based on age (45 and under, versus 46 and up) the expectation is that
each row with age 45 and under must count as 1.5 observations, and therefore the Good and Bad
“counts” are increased by 50%:

The “counts” are now “weighted frequencies” and are no longer integer values. The Odds do not
change for the first bin. The particular weights given in this example have the effect of scaling the
total Good and Bad counts in the first bin by the same scaling factor, therefore their ratio does not
change. However, the Odds value of the total sample does change; the first bin now carries a higher
weight, and because the odds in that bin are lower, the total Odds are now lower, too. Other credit
scorecard statistics not shown here, such as WOE and Information Value are affected in a similar
way.

In general, the effect of weights is not simply to scale frequencies in a particular bin, because
members of that bin will have different weights. The goal of this example is to demonstrate the
concept of switching from counts to the sum of weights.
