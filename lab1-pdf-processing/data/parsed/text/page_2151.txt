General Declining-Balance Depreciation Schedule

A general declining-balance depreciation schedule is a method of calculating depreciation that
applies a fixed percentage rate to the book value of an asset at the beginning of each period.

This approach results in a decreasing amount of depreciation expense over the asset's useful life,
reflecting the declining value of the asset as it ages. It is commonly used for assets that lose value
more quickly in their earlier years.
