Bond Portfolio CVaR Optimization Using Diebold-Li Model

This example shows how to perform bond portfolio optimization by using the Diebold-Li dynamic
factor model of the yield curve to simulate and compute bond returns.

For observation date t and time to maturity τ, the Diebold-Li model of the yield is given by

yt τ = Lt + St

1 −e−λτ

λτ
+ Ct

1 −e−λτ

λτ
−e−λτ ,

where:

•
Lt is the long-term factor (level).

•
St is the short-term factor (slope).

•
Ct is the medium-term factor (curvature).

•
λ determines the maturity at which the loading curve is maximized and goversn the exponential
decay rate of the model.

State-Space Formulation of Diebold-Li Model

In this example, you use the model from the “Apply State-Space Methodology to Analyze Diebold-Li
Yield Curve Model” (Econometrics Toolbox) example to calculate the monthly returns. The associated
ssm (Econometrics Toolbox) model is described in Load Yield Curve Data and ssm Model on page 5-
147.

The level, slope, and curvature factors of the Diebold-Li model follow the state transition equation
given by

Lt −μL
St −μS
Ct −μC

=

a11 a12 a13
a21 a22 a23
a31 a32 a33

Lt −1 −μL
St −1 −μS
Ct −1 −μC

+

ηLt
ηSt
ηCt

where μ is the vector of means for each factor, and the corresponding observation equation is

You can represent these two sets of equations in the following vector representation

ft −μ = A ft −1 −μ + ηt
yt = Λft + εt

If you define the latent states xt as the mean-adjusted factors
