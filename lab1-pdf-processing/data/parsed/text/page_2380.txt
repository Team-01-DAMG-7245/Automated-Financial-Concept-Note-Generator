Maturity dates that correspond to the ZeroRates, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of maturity
dates that correspond to the zero rates in ZeroRates. This vector is the same as the input vector
CurveDates, but is sorted by ascending maturity.

If both inputs for CurveDates and Settle are strings or date character vectors, CurveDates is
returned as serial date numbers. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to
formatted datetime arrays. However, if either of the inputs for CurveDates and Settle are a
datetime array, CurveDates is returned as a datetime array.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although fwd2zero supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
