Budget Constraint Bounds

Budget constraint bounds are the limitations placed on the total amount of capital that can be
allocated to different assets within a portfolio.

Budget constraint bounds ensure that the total investment does not exceed the available capital and
that the portfolio adheres to the investor's financial guidelines.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to obtain the budget constraint bounds from portfolio objects.

[LowerBudget, UpperBudget] = obj.getBudget;
