addGroupRatio

Add group ratio constraints for portfolio weights to existing group ratio constraints

Syntax

obj = addGroupRatio(obj,GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio)
obj = addGroupRatio(obj,GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio,UpperRatio)

Description

obj = addGroupRatio(obj,GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio) adds group ratio constraints for
portfolio weights to existing group ratio constraints for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD objects. For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects,
see “Portfolio Object Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and
“PortfolioMAD Object Workflow” on page 6-16.

Given base and comparison group matrices GroupA and GroupB and, either LowerRatio, or
UpperRatio bounds, group ratio constraints require any portfolio in Port to satisfy the following:

(GroupB * Port) .* LowerRatio <= GroupA * Port <= (GroupB * Port) .* UpperRatio

Note This collection of constraints usually requires that portfolio weights be nonnegative and that
the products GroupA * Port and GroupB * Port are always nonnegative. Although negative
portfolio weights and non-Boolean group ratio matrices are supported, use with caution.

obj = addGroupRatio(obj,GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio,UpperRatio) adds group ratio
constraints for portfolio weights to existing group ratio constraints with an additional option for
UpperRatio.

Given base and comparison group matrices GroupA and GroupB and, either LowerRatio, or
UpperRatio bounds, group ratio constraints require any portfolio in Port to satisfy the following:

(GroupB * Port) .* LowerRatio <= GroupA * Port <= (GroupB * Port) .* UpperRatio

Note This collection of constraints usually requires that portfolio weights be nonnegative and that
the products GroupA * Port and GroupB * Port are always nonnegative. Although negative
portfolio weights and non-Boolean group ratio matrices are supported, use with caution.

Examples

Add Group Ratio Constraints to a Portfolio Object

Set a group ratio constraint to ensure that the weight in financial assets does not exceed 50% of the
weight in nonfinancial assets. Then add another group ratio constraint to ensure that the weight in
financial assets constitute at least 20% of the weight in nonfinancial assets of the portfolio.

p = Portfolio;
GA = [ true true true false false false ];    % financial companies
