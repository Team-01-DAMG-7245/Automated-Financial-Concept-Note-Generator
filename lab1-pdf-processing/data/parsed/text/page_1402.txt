drift

Drift-rate model component

Description

The drift object specifies the drift-rate component of continuous-time stochastic differential
equations (SDEs).

The drift-rate specification supports the simulation of sample paths of NVars state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods,
approximating continuous-time stochastic processes.

The drift-rate specification can be any NVars-by-1 vector-valued function F of the general form:

F(t, Xt) = A(t) + B(t)Xt

where:

•
A is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

•
B is an NVars-by-NVars matrix-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

And a drift-rate specification is associated with a vector-valued SDE of the form

dXt = F(t, Xt)dt + G(t, Xt)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
A and B are model parameters.

The drift-rate specification is flexible, and provides direct parametric support for static/linear drift
models. It is also extensible, and provides indirect support for dynamic/nonlinear models via an
interface. This enables you to specify virtually any drift-rate specification.
