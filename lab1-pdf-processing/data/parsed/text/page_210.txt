Since mean-variance portfolio optimization problems require estimates for the mean and covariance
of asset returns, the Portfolio object has several ways to set and get the properties AssetMean
(for the mean) and AssetCovar (for the covariance). In addition, the return for a riskless asset is
kept in the property RiskFreeRate so that all assets in AssetMean and AssetCovar are risky
assets. For information on the workflow when using Portfolio objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18.

Assignment Using the Portfolio Function

Suppose that you have a mean and covariance of asset returns in variables m and C. The properties
for the moments of asset returns are set using the Portfolio object:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
    0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
    0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
    0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];
m = m/12;
C = C/12;
p = Portfolio('AssetMean', m, 'AssetCovar', C);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.AssetMean)
disp(p.AssetCovar)

         0    0.0010    0.0028    0.0102

Notice that the Portfolio object determines the number of assets in NumAssets from the moments.
The Portfolio object enables separate initialization of the moments, for example:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
