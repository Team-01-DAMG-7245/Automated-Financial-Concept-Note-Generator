Credit Scorecard Modeling with Missing Values

This example shows how to handle missing values when you work with creditscorecard objects.
First, the example shows how to use the creditscorecard functionality to create an explicit bin for
missing data with corresponding points. Then, this example describes four different ways to "treat"
the missing data on page 8-62 to get a final credit scorecard with no explicit bins for missing values.

Develop a Credit Scorecard with Explicit Bins for Missing Values

When you create a creditscorecard object, the data can contain missing values. When using
creditscorecard to create a creditscorecard object, you can set the name-value pair argument
for 'BinMissingData' set to true. In this case, the missing data for numeric predictors (NaN
values) and for categorical predictors (<undefined> values) is binned in a separate bin labeled
<missing> that appears at the end of the bins. Predictors with no missing values in the training data
have no <missing> bin. If you do not specify the 'BinMissingData' argument or if you set
'BinMissingData' to false, the creditscorecard function discards missing observations when
computing frequencies of Good and Bad, and neither the bininfo nor plotbins functions reports
such observations.

The <missing> bin remains in place throughout the scorecard modeling process. The final scorecard
explicitly indicates the points to be assigned to missing values for predictors that have a <missing>
bin. These points are determined from the weight-of-evidence (WOE) value of the <missing> bin and
the predictor's coefficient in the logistic model. For predictors without an explicit <missing> bin,
you can assign points to missing values using the name-value pair argument 'Missing' in
formatpoints, as described in this example, or by using one of the four different ways to "treat" the
missing data on page 8-62.

The dataMissing table in the CreditCardData.mat file has two predictors with missing values â€”
CustAge and ResStatus.

load CreditCardData.mat
head(dataMissing,5)

Create a creditscorecard object using the CreditCardData.mat file to load the dataMissing
table with missing values. Set the 'BinMissingData' argument to true. Apply automatic binning.

sc = creditscorecard(dataMissing,'IDVar','CustID','BinMissingData',true);
sc = autobinning(sc);

The bin information and bin plots for the predictors that have missing data both show a <missing>
bin at the end.

bi = bininfo(sc,'CustAge');
disp(bi)
