fwd2zero

Zero curve given forward curve

Note In R2017b, the specification of optional input arguments has changed. While the previous
ordered inputs syntax is still supported, it may no longer be supported in a future release. Use the
new optional name-value pair inputs: InputCompounding, InputBasis, OutputCompounding, and
OutputBasis.

Syntax

[ZeroRates,CurveDates] = fwd2zero(ForwardRates,CurveDates,Settle)
[ZeroRates,CurveDates] = fwd2zero( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[ZeroRates,CurveDates] = fwd2zero(ForwardRates,CurveDates,Settle) returns a zero
curve given an implied forward rate curve and its maturity dates. If both inputs for CurveDates and
Settle are strings or date character vectors, CurveDates is returned as serial date numbers.
However, if either of the inputs for CurveDates and Settle are a datetime array, CurveDates is
returned as a datetime array.

[ZeroRates,CurveDates] = fwd2zero( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional name-value pair
arguments

Examples

Compute the Zero Curve Given the Forward Curve Using datetime Inputs

This example shows how to use datetime inputs compute the zero curve, given an implied forward
rate curve over a set of maturity dates, a settlement date, and a compounding rate.

ForwardRates = [0.0469
                0.0519
                0.0549
                0.0535
                0.0558
                0.0508
                0.0560
                0.0545
                0.0615
                0.0486];

CurveDates = [datetime(2000,11,6) 
              datetime(2000,12,11) 
              datetime(2001,1,15) 
              datetime(2001,2,5) 
              datetime(2001,3,4) 
              datetime(2001,4,2)
