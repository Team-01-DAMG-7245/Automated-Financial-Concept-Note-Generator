•
If specified, the random noise process Z is a three-dimensional array.

•
If Z is unspecified, the assumed Gaussian correlation structure is a double matrix.

Creating Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) Models

The Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model (cev) also derives directly from the linear drift
(sdeld) model:

dXt = μ(t)Xtdt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt

The cev object constrains A to an NVars-by-1 vector of zeros. D is a diagonal matrix whose elements
are the corresponding element of the state vector X, raised to an exponent α(t).

Specify Univariate Constant Elasticity of Variance Model

Create a univariate cev object to represent the model using cev. The cev model derives from the
sdeld (SDE with drift rate expressed in linear form) class and takes the form:

obj = cev(0.25, 0.5, 0.3) % (B = Return, Alpha, Sigma)

obj = 
   Class CEV: Constant Elasticity of Variance
   ------------------------------------------
     Dimensions: State = 1, Brownian = 1
   ------------------------------------------
      StartTime: 0
     StartState: 1
    Correlation: 1
          Drift: drift rate function F(t,X(t)) 
      Diffusion: diffusion rate function G(t,X(t)) 
     Simulation: simulation method/function simByEuler
         Return: 0.25
          Alpha: 0.5
          Sigma: 0.3

cev and gbm objects display the parameter B as the more familiar Return.

Creating Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Models

The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model (gbm) derives directly from the CEV (cev) model:

dXt = μ(t)Xtdt + D(t, Xt)V(t)dWt

Compared to the cev object, a gbm object constrains all elements of the alpha exponent vector to one
such that D is now a diagonal matrix with the state vector X along the main diagonal.

The gbm object also provides two simulation methods that can be used by separable models:
