Use fitmodel to fit a logistic regression model using WOE values. fitmodel internally transforms
all the predictor variables into WOE values, using the bins found during the automatic binning
process. By default, fitmodel then fits a logistic regression model using a stepwise method. For
predictors that have missing data, there is an explicit <missing> bin with a corresponding WOE
value computed from the data. When you use fitmodel, the corresponding WOE value for the
<missing> bin is applied when the function performs the WOE transformation.

[sc,mdl] = fitmodel(sc,'display','off');

Scale the scorecard points by the points-to-double-the-odds (PDO) method using the
'PointsOddsAndPDO' argument of formatpoints. Suppose that you want a score of 500 points to
have odds of 2 (twice as likely to be good than to be bad) and that the odds double every 50 points (so
that 550 points would have odds of 4).

Display the scorecard showing the scaled points for predictors retained in the fitting model.

sc = formatpoints(sc,'PointsOddsAndPDO',[500 2 50]);
PointsInfo = displaypoints(sc)

Notice that points for the <missing> bins for CustAge and ResStatus are explicitly shown (as
64.9836 and 74.1250, respectively). These points are computed from the WOE value for the
<missing> bin and the logistic model coefficients.

Points for predictors that have no missing data in the training set, by default, are set to NaN and they
lead to a score of NaN when you run score. This can be changed by updating the name-value pair
argument 'Missing' in formatpoints to indicate how to treat missing data for scoring purposes.

The scorecard is ready for scoring new data sets. You can also use the scorecard to compute
probabilities of default or perform model validation. For details, see score, probdefault, and
