The estimated minimum objective coincides with the minimum observed objective (the search is
monotonic). Unlike derivative-based algorithms, bayesopt does not converge. As it tries to find the
global minimum, bayesopt continues exploring until it reaches the specified number of iterations
(25).

Obtain the best configuration by passing the results to bestPoint.

[Calibration,negReturn] = bestPoint(results,'Criterion','min-observed')

Trading one share per tick, as directed by Q, the optimal strategy using (n,N) = (3,24) returns $0.71
over the final 20% of the trading day. Modifying the trading volume scales the return.

Another optimizer designed for expensive objectives is surrogateopt (Global Optimization Toolbox).
It uses a different search strategy and can locate optima more quickly, depending on the objective.
The supporting function optimizeTrading2.m uses surrogateopt instead of bayesopt to
optimize the trading strategy in tradeOnQ.
