equityCurve

Plot equity curves of strategies

Syntax

equityCurve(backtester)
h = equityCurve(ax,backtester)

Description

equityCurve(backtester) plots the equity curves of each strategy that you create using
backtestStrategy. After creating the backtesting engine using backtestEngine and running the
backtest with runBacktest, use equityCurve to plot the strategies and compare their
performance.

h = equityCurve(ax,backtester) additionally returns the figure handle h for the equity curve
plot.

Examples

Generate Equity Curve for Backtest

The MATLABÂ® backtesting engine runs backtests of portfolio investment strategies over time series
of asset price data. After creating a set of backtest strategies using backtestStrategy and the
backtesting engine using backtestEngine, the runBacktest function executes the backtest. After
using the runBacktest function to test investment strategies, you can run the equityCurve
function to plot the equity curves of strategies.

Load Data

Load one year of stock price data. For readability, this example uses only a subset of the DJIA stocks.

% Read a table of daily adjusted close prices for 2006 DJIA stocks
T = readtable('dowPortfolio.xlsx');

% Prune the table to hold only the dates and selected stocks
timeColumn = "Dates";
assetSymbols = ["BA", "CAT", "DIS", "GE", "IBM", "MCD", "MSFT"];
T = T(:,[timeColumn assetSymbols]);

% Convert to timetable
pricesTT = table2timetable(T,'RowTimes','Dates');

% View the final asset price timetable
head(pricesTT)

Dates        BA       CAT      DIS      GE       IBM      MCD     MSFT
