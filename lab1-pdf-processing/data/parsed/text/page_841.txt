Working with Group Constraints Using PortfolioMAD Object

Group constraints are optional linear constraints that group assets together and enforce bounds on
the group weights (see “Group Constraints” on page 6-11). Although the constraints are implemented
as general constraints, the usual convention is to form a group matrix that identifies membership of
each asset within a specific group with Boolean indicators (either true or false or with 1 or 0) for
each element in the group matrix. Group constraints have properties GroupMatrix for the group
membership matrix, LowerGroup for the lower-bound constraint on groups, and UpperGroup for the
upper-bound constraint on groups.

Setting Group Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD Function

The properties for group constraints are set through the PortfolioMAD object. Suppose that you
have a portfolio of five assets and want to ensure that the first three assets constitute no more than
30% of your portfolio, then you can set group constraints:

G = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
p = PortfolioMAD('GroupMatrix', G, 'UpperGroup', 0.3);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupMatrix)
disp(p.UpperGroup)

1     1     1     0     0

0.3000

The group matrix G can also be a logical matrix so that the following code achieves the same result.

G = [ true true true false false ];
p = PortfolioMAD('GroupMatrix', G, 'UpperGroup', 0.3);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupMatrix)
disp(p.UpperGroup)

1     1     1     0     0

Setting Group Constraints Using the setGroups and addGroups
Functions

You can also set the properties for group constraints using setGroups. Suppose that you have a
portfolio of five assets and want to ensure that the first three assets constitute no more than 30% of
your portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use setGroups to set the group constraints:

G = [ true true true false false ];
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
disp(p.NumAssets);
disp(p.GroupMatrix);
disp(p.UpperGroup);
