blsprice

Black-Scholes put and call option pricing

Syntax

[Call,Put] = blsprice(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
[Call,Put] = blsprice( ___ ,Yield)

Description

[Call,Put] = blsprice(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) computes European put
and call option prices using a Black-Scholes model.

Note Any input argument can be a scalar, vector, or matrix. If a scalar, then that value is used to
price all options. If more than one input is a vector or matrix, then the dimensions of those non-scalar
inputs must be the same.

Ensure that Rate, Time, Volatility, and Yield are expressed in consistent units of time.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or Binary
instrument using a BlackScholes model.

[Call,Put] = blsprice( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional an argument for Yield.

Examples

Compute European Put and Call Option Prices Using a Black-Scholes Model

This example shows how to price European stock options that expire in three months with an exercise
price of $95. Assume that the underlying stock pays no dividend, trades at $100, and has a volatility
of 50% per annum. The risk-free rate is 10% per annum.

[Call, Put] = blsprice(100, 95, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5)

Call = 
13.6953

Put = 
6.3497

Compute European Put and Call Option Prices on a Stock Index Using a Black-Scholes Model

The S&P 100 index is at 910 and has a volatility of 25% per annum. The risk-free rate of interest is
2% per annum and the index provides a dividend yield of 2.5% per annum. Calculate the value of a
three-month European call and put with a strike price of 980.
