fanplot

Plot combined historical and forecast data to visualize possible outcomes

Syntax

fanplot(historical,forecast)
fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value)

fanplot(ax,historical,forecast)
fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value)

h = fanplot(ax,historical,forecast)
[h,ax] = fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

fanplot(historical,forecast) generates a fan chart. In time series analysis, a fan chart is a
chart that joins a simple line chart for observed past data with ranges for possible values of future
data. The historical data and possible future data are joined with a line showing a central estimate or
most likely value for the future outcomes.

fanplot supports three plotting scenarios:

•
Matching — This scenario occurs when the time period perfectly matches for historical and
forecast data.

•
Backtest — This scenario occurs when there are overlaps between historical and forecast
data.

•
Gap — This scenario occurs when there are NaN values in the historical or forecast data.

fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value) generates a fan chart using optional name-value pair arguments.

fanplot(ax,historical,forecast) generates a fan chart using an optional ax argument.

fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value) generates a fan chart using optional name-value pair arguments.

h = fanplot(ax,historical,forecast) generates a fan chart and returns the figure handle h.

[h,ax] = fanplot( ___ ,Name,Value) generates a fan chart and returns the figure handle h and
axis (ax) using optional name-value pair arguments.
