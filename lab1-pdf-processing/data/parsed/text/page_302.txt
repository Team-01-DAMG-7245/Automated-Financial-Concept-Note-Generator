Case for Solving
Portfolio Problem

Objective Function
Constraints
Integer (Binary)
Variables

"Preferred" case with
Financial Toolbox

•
Return — Gross
portfolio returns or
net portfolio returns

•
Risk — Variance,
CVaR, or MAD

•
Sharpe ratio (only
for mean-variance
problems using
Portfolio object)

•
Continuous functions
(only using the
Portfolio object)

•
Return — Gross
portfolio returns or
net portfolio returns

•
Risk — Variance,
CVaR, or MAD (risk
constraints are only
supported when the
objective is the
return)

•
Linear equalities

•
Linear inequalities

•
Tracking error (only
for mean-variance
problems using
Portfolio object).
Tracking error is
supported with
custom objectives
using
estimateCustomOb
jectivePortfolio
. Tracking error is
only supported when
the objective is the
return, variance, or
Sharpe ratio.

Always Use Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD Object

The two general cases for always using the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object
are:

•
Problems with both supported nonlinear constraints and conditional bounds or bounds in the
number of assets.
