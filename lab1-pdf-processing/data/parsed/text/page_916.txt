The value of this investment is $50.84 in month 2, but by month 18 the value is down to $42.41, a
drop of $8.43. This is the largest loss in dollar value from a previous high in the given time period. In
this case, the maximum drawdown period, 2nd to 18th month, is the same independently of whether
drawdown is measured as return or as dollar value loss.

Finally, you can compute the maximum decline based on log-returns using the geometric argument.
In this example, the log-returns result in a maximum drop of 18.13%, again from the second to the
18th month, not far from the 16.58% obtained using standard returns.

[MaxDD50LogRet, Ind50LogRet] = maxdrawdown(Fund50,'geometric')

MaxDD50LogRet = 
0.1813

Ind50LogRet = 2Ã—1

Note, the last measure is equivalent to finding the arithmetic maximum drawdown for the log of the
series.

MaxDD50LogRet2 = maxdrawdown(log(Fund50),'arithmetic')

MaxDD50LogRet2 = 
0.1813

Expected Maximum Drawdown

This example shows how to use the log-return moments of the fund to compute the expected
maximum drawdown (EMaxDD) and then compare it with the realized maximum drawdown (MaxDD).

load FundMarketCash
logReturns = log(TestData(2:end,:) ./ TestData(1:end - 1,:));
Mu = mean(logReturns(:,1));
Sigma = std(logReturns(:,1),1);
T = size(logReturns,1);

MaxDD = maxdrawdown(TestData(:,1),'geometric')

MaxDD = 
0.1813

EMaxDD = emaxdrawdown(Mu, Sigma, T)

EMaxDD = 
0.1545

The drawdown observed in this time period is above the expected maximum drawdown. There is no
contradiction here. The expected maximum drawdown is not an upper bound on the maximum losses
from a peak, but an estimate of their average, based on a geometric Brownian motion assumption.
