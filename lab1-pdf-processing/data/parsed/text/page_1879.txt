Data Types: char | string | datetime

Face — Face value of bond
100 (default) | numeric

Face value of the bond, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Face' and a scalar or a
NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.

Data Types: double

CompoundingFrequency — Compounding frequency for yield calculation
SIA bases uses2, ICMA bases uses 1 (default) | integer with value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12

Compounding frequency for yield calculation, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'CompoundingFrequency' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

Note By default, SIA bases (0-7) and BUS/252 use a semiannual compounding convention and ICMA
bases (8-12) use an annual compounding convention.

Data Types: double

DiscountBasis — Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield
SIA uses 0 (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'DiscountBasis' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.
Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)
