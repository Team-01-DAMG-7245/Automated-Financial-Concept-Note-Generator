•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If a SIA day-count basis is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value assigned
for DiscountBasis, the default behavior is for SIA bases to use the actual/actual day count to
compute discount factors.

If an ICMA day-count basis or BUS/252 is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value
assigned for DiscountBasis, the specified bases from the Basis input argument are used.

Data Types: double

LastCouponInterest — Compounding convention for computing yield of a bond in last
coupon period
compound (default) | values are simple or compound

Compounding convention for computing the yield of a bond in the last coupon period, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'LastCouponInterest' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-
by-NUMBONDS vector. LastCouponInterest is based on only the last coupon and the face value to
be repaid. Acceptable values are:

•
simple

•
compound

Data Types: char | cell

Output Arguments

Spread — Static spread to benchmark in basis points
numeric

Static spread to benchmark, returned in basis points as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

More About

Z-Spread

Z-spread, or static spread, is a measure used in fixed-income analysis to assess the yield spread of a
bond over the benchmark yield curve, specifically the risk-free rate, when the bond is assumed to be
held to maturity.

The Z-spread represents the constant spread that an investor would add to the yield of a benchmark
yield curve (typically the Treasury yield curve) to discount the bond's future cash flows to its current
market price.
