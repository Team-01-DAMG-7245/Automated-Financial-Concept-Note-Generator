Setting the Limits on the Number of Assets Invested Using the
setMinMaxNumAssets Function

You can also set the MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets properties to define a limit on the number of
assets invested using setMinMaxNumAssets. For example, by setting
MinNumAssets=MaxNumAssets=2, only two of the three assets are invested in the portfolio.

p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setBounds(p, 0.02, 0.5,'BoundType', 'Conditional', 'NumAssets', 3)
p = setMinMaxNumAssets(p, 2, 2)

p =
