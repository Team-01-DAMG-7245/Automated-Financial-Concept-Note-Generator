Note If OutputCompounding is not specified, then OutputCompounding is assigned the value
specified for InputCompounding. If either InputCompounding or OutputCompounding are not
specified, the default is 2 (semiannual) for both.

Data Types: double

OutputBasis — Day-count basis of output zero rates
0 (default) | numeric values: 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Day count basis of output zero rates, specified as a numeric value. Allowed values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If OutputBasis is not specified, then OutputBasis is assigned the value specified for
InputBasis. If either InputBasis or OutputBasis are not specified, the default is 0 (actual/
actual) for both.

Output Arguments

ZeroRates — Zero curve for investment horizon represented by CurveDates
numeric

Zero curve for the investment horizon represented by CurveDates, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1
vector of decimal fractions. In aggregate, the rates in ZeroRates constitute a zero curve for the
investment horizon represented by CurveDates.

CurveDates — Maturity dates that correspond to ZeroRates
datetime | serial date number
