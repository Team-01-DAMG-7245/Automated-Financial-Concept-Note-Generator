addInequality

Add linear inequality constraints for portfolio weights to existing constraints

Syntax

obj = addInequality(obj,AInequality,bInequality)

Description

obj = addInequality(obj,AInequality,bInequality) adds linear inequality constraints for
portfolio weights to existing constraints for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD objects.
For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

Given a linear inequality constraint matrix AInequality and vector bInequality, every weight in
a portfolio Port must satisfy the following:

AInequality * Port <= bInequality

This function "stacks" additional linear inequality constraints onto any existing linear inequality
constraints that exist in the input portfolio object. If no constraints exist, this function is the same as
setInequality.

Examples

Add Linear Inequality Constraint to a Portfolio Object

Set a linear inequality constraint to ensure that the first three assets constitute at most 50% of a
portfolio. Then add another linear inequality constraint to ensure that the last three assets constitute
at least 50% of a portfolio.

p = Portfolio;
A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];    % first inequality constraint
b = 0.5;
p = setInequality(p, A, b);

A = [ 0 0 -1 -1 -1 ];    % second inequality constraint
b = -0.5;
p = addInequality(p, A, b);

disp(p.NumAssets);
