Obtaining Efficient Portfolios for Target Returns

This example shows how to obtain efficient portfolios that have targeted portfolio returns using the
estimateFrontierByReturn function.

The estimateFrontierByReturn function accepts one or more target portfolios returns and
obtains efficient portfolios with the specified returns. For example, assume that you have a universe
of four assets where you want to obtain efficient portfolios with target portfolio returns of 6%, 9%,
and 12%:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
    0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
    0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
    0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

AssetScenarios = mvnrnd(m, C, 20000);

p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setScenarios(p, AssetScenarios);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
p = setProbabilityLevel(p, 0.95);

pwgt = estimateFrontierByReturn(p, [0.07,  0.10, .12]);
display(pwgt)

pwgt = 4×3

0.7435    0.3656    0.1088
    0.1257    0.3411    0.4946
    0.0510    0.0782    0.0939
    0.0799    0.2151    0.3027

Sometimes, you can request a return for which no efficient portfolio exists. Based on the previous
code, suppose that you want a portfolio with a 4% return (which is the return of the first asset). A
portfolio that is fully invested in the first asset, however, is inefficient. estimateFrontierByReturn
warns if your target returns are outside the range of efficient portfolio returns and replaces it with
the endpoint portfolio of the efficient frontier closest to your target return The best way to avoid this
situation is to bracket your target portfolio returns with estimateFrontierLimits and
estimatePortReturn (see “Obtaining Endpoints of the Efficient Frontier” on page 5-89 and
“Obtaining CVaR Portfolio Risks and Returns” on page 5-105).

pret = estimatePortReturn(p, p.estimateFrontierLimits);
display(pret)

pret = 2×1

0.0657
    0.1790

This result indicates that efficient portfolios have returns that range from 6.5% to 17.8%. Note, your
results for this code may be different due to the random generation of scenarios.
