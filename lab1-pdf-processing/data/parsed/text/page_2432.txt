Tracking error, also know as active risk, measures the volatility of active returns. Tracking error is a
useful measure of performance relative to a benchmark since it is in units of asset returns. For
example, the tracking error of 1.87% for the fund relative to the market in this example is reasonable
for an actively managed, large-cap value fund.

Input Arguments

Asset — Asset returns
matrix

Asset returns, specified as a NUMSAMPLES x NUMSERIES matrix with NUMSAMPLES observations of
asset returns for NUMSERIES asset return series.

Data Types: double

Benchmark — Returns for a benchmark asset
vector

Returns for a benchmark asset, specified as a NUMSAMPLES vector of returns for a benchmark asset.
The periodicity must be the same as the periodicity of Asset. For example, if Asset is monthly data,
then Benchmark should be monthly returns.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

Ratio — Information ratios
vector

Information ratios, returned as a 1 x NUMSERIES row vector of information ratios for each series in
Asset. Any series in Asset with a tracking error of 0 has a NaN value for its information ratio.

TE — Tracking errors
vector

Tracking errors, returned as a 1 x NUMSERIES row vector of tracking errors, that is, the standard
deviation of Asset relative to Benchmark returns, for each series.

Note NaN values in the data are ignored. If the Asset and Benchmark series are identical, the
information ratio is NaN since the tracking error is 0. The information ratio and the Sharpe ratio of an
