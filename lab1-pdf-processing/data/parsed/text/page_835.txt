Setting 'Simple' Bounds Using the PortfolioMAD Function or
setBounds Function

Both the PortfolioMAD object and setBounds function implement scalar expansion on either the
LowerBound or UpperBound properties. If the NumAssets property is already set in the
PortfolioMAD object, scalar arguments for either property expand to have the same value across all
dimensions. In addition, setBounds lets you specify NumAssets as an optional argument. Suppose
that you have a universe of 500 assets and you want to set common bound constraints on all assets in
your universe. Specifically, you are a long-only investor and want to hold no more than 5% of your
portfolio in any single asset. You can set these bound constraints in any of these equivalent ways:

p = PortfolioMAD('NumAssets', 500, 'LowerBound', 0, 'UpperBound', 0.05,'BoundType', 'Simple');

or

p = PortfolioMAD('NumAssets', 500);
p = setBounds(p, 0, 0.05,'BoundType','Simple');

or

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setBounds(p, 0, 0.05,'NumAssets', 500,'BoundType','Simple');

To clear bound constraints from your PortfolioMAD object, use either the PortfolioMAD object or
setBounds with empty inputs for the properties to be cleared. For example, to clear the upper-bound
constraint from the PortfolioMAD object p in the previous example:

p = PortfolioMAD(p, 'UpperBound', []);
