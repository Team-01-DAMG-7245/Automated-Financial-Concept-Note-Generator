Risk Budgeting Portfolio

This example shows how to use riskBudgetingPortfolio to create a risk budgeting portfolio and
portfolioRiskContribution to compute the risk contribution of the assets in the portfolio.

Risk budgeting is a portfolio allocation strategy that focuses on the allocation of risk to define the
weights of a portfolio. The risk budgeting portfolio is constructed by ensuring that the risk
contribution of each asset to the portfolio overall risk matches a target risk budget.

A common risk budgeting portfolio is the risk parity or equal risk contribution portfolio. For risk
parity portfolios, the goal is to ensure that all assets contribute equally to the portfolio risk, that is,
the target risk budget is the same for all assets. Key advantages of the risk budgeting portfolio are
stability and diversification of weights:

•
Stability of the allocations: The weights of the risk parity portfolio are more robust to changes
in the returns covariance than the weights of the mean-variance portfolio.

•
Diversification of the portfolio weights: The risk parity portfolio keeps the portfolio from
concentrating in just a few number of assets.

This example follows the example in Section 3.1.1 of Bruder and Roncalli.[1 on page 4-290]

Define the Asset Returns Covariance

Define the covariance matrix of the asset returns (Sigma). Sigma must be a positive semidefinite
matrix.

% Define the returns covariance matrix.
sigma = [0.2; 0.21; 0.1];       % Assets risk
rho = 0.8;                      % Assets correlation
C = @(rho) [  1  rho  rho;
            rho    1  rho;
            rho  rho    1 ];    % Uniform correlation
Sigma = corr2cov(sigma,C(rho)); % Covariance
% Check that Sigma is positive semidefinite. All
% eigenvalues should be nonnegative (>= 0).
eig(Sigma)

ans = 3×1

Create Risk Budgeting Portfolio

Use riskBudgetingPortfolio with the covariance matrix (Sigma) and a vector of risk budgets
(budget) to compute the long-only fully invested risk budgeting portfolio. When you specify the
target risk budget, the function computes the risk parity portfolio.

% Define a risk budget.
budget = [0.5; 0.25; 0.25];
wRB = riskBudgetingPortfolio(Sigma,budget)

wRB = 3×1
