IssueDate — Bond issue date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Bond issue date (the date the bond begins to accrue interest), specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'IssueDate' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array,
or date character vectors. The IssueDate cannot be after the Settle date.

If you do not specify an IssueDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

FirstCouponDate — Irregular or normal first coupon date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Irregular or normal first coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'FirstCouponDate' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or
date character vectors.

If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

Note When FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified, the FirstCouponDate
takes precedence in determining the coupon payment structure. If FirstCouponDate is not
specified, then LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the bond.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Irregular or normal last coupon date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Irregular or normal last coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'LastCouponDate' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or
date character vectors.

Note When FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified, the FirstCouponDate
takes precedence in determining the coupon payment structure. If FirstCouponDate is not
specified, then LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the bond.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.
