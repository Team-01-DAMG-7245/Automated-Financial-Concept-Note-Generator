For a continuous probability distribution, the hazard function is a function of the survival function
with

h(x) = lim

and the survival functions is a function of the hazard function with

Life table models generally specify either the hazard function or the survival function. However, life
tables are discrete and work with discrete versions of the hazard and survival functions. Three series
are used for life tables and the notation is the convention. The discrete hazard function is denoted as

qx ≈h(x)

= 1 −s(x + 1)
s(x)

which is the probability a person at age x dies by age x + 1 (where x is in years). The discrete survival
function is presented in terms of an initial number of survivors at birth called the life table radix
(which is usually 100,000 individuals) and is denoted as

lx = l0s(x)

with radix l0 = 100000. This number, lx, represents the number of individuals out of 100,000 at birth
who are still alive at age x.

A third series is related to the probability density function which is the number of "standardized"
deaths in a given year denoted as

dx = lx −lx + 1

Based on a few additional rules about how to initialize and terminate these series, any one series can
be derived from any of the other series.
