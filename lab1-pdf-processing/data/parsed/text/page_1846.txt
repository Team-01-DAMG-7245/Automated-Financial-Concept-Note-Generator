IssueDate — Bond issue date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Bond Issue date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'IssueDate' and a scalar or a
NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors.

If you do not specify an IssueDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, bnddurp also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

FirstCouponDate — Irregular or normal first coupon date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Irregular or normal first coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'FirstCouponDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime
array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, bnddurp also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Irregular or normal last coupon date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Irregular or normal last coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'LastCouponDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime
array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, bnddurp also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

StartDate — Forward starting date of payments
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Forward starting date of payments, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'StartDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a datetime array,
string array, or date character vectors. The StartDate is when a bond actually starts (the date from
which a bond cash flow is considered). To make an instrument forward-starting, specify this date as a
future date.

If you do not specify a StartDate, the effective start date is the Settle date.

To support existing code, bnddurp also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.
