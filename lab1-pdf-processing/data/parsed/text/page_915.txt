Although the maximum drawdown is measured in terms of returns, maxdrawdown can measure the
drawdown in terms of absolute drop in value, or in terms of log-returns. To contrast these alternatives
more clearly, you can work with the fund series assuming, an initial investment of 50 dollars.

Fund50 = 50*TestData(:,1);
plot(Fund50);
title('\bfFive-Year Fund Performance, Initial Investment 50 usd');
xlabel('Months');
ylabel('Value of Investment');

Compute the standard maximum drawdown, which coincides with the results above because returns
are independent of the initial amounts invested.

MaxDD50Ret = maxdrawdown(Fund50)

MaxDD50Ret = 
0.1658

Compute the maximum drop in value, using the arithmetic argument.

[MaxDD50Arith, Ind50Arith] = maxdrawdown(Fund50,'arithmetic')

MaxDD50Arith = 
8.4285

Ind50Arith = 2Ã—1
