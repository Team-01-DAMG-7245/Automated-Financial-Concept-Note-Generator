Working with Tracking Error Constraints Using Portfolio Object

Tracking error constraints are optional constraints (see “Tracking Error Constraints” on page 4-15)
that measure the risk relative to a portfolio called a tracking portfolio. Tracking error constraints can
be set using the Portfolio object or the setTrackingError function.

The tracking error constraint is an optional quadratic constraint that enforces an upper bound on
tracking error, which is the relative risk between a portfolio and a designated tracking portfolio. For
more information, see “Tracking Error Constraints” on page 4-15.

The tracking error constraint can be set using the Portfolio object or the setTrackingPort and
setTrackingError functions. The tracking error constraint depends on a tracking portfolio, which
is assumed to be zero if not set when the tracking error constraint is set. The tracking error
constraint has properties TrackingError, for the upper bound on tracking error, and
TrackingPort, for the portfolio against which tracking error is computed.

Note The initial portfolio in the Portfolio object property InitPort is distinct from the tracking
portfolio in the Portfolio object property TrackingPort.

Setting Tracking Error Constraints Using the Portfolio Function

The properties for the tracking error constraints are set using the Portfolio object. Suppose that
you have a tracking portfolio of 10 assets in a variable x0 and you want to ensure that the tracking
error of any portfolio on the efficient frontier is no more than 8% relative to this portfolio. To set this
constraint:

x0 = [ 0.12; 0.09; 0.08; 0.07; 0.1; 0.1; 0.15; 0.11; 0.08; 0.1 ]; 
p = Portfolio('TrackingError', 0.08, 'TrackingPort', x0);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.TrackingError)
disp(p.TrackingPort)

    0.1500
    0.1100
    0.0800
    0.1000

If the NumAssets or TrackingPort properties are not set before or when the tracking error
constraint is set, various rules are applied to assign default values to these properties (see “Setting
Up a Tracking Portfolio” on page 4-40).

Setting Tracking Error Constraints Using the setTrackingError Function

You can also set properties for portfolio tracking error using the setTrackingError function to
specify both the upper bound for tracking error and a designated tracking portfolio. Suppose that you
