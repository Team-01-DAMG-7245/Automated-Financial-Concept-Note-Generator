bnddurp

Bond duration given price

Syntax

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddurp(Price,CouponRate,Settle,
Maturity)
[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddurp( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddurp(Price,CouponRate,Settle,
Maturity) computes the Macaulay and modified duration of NUMBONDS fixed-income securities
given a clean price for each bond.

bnddurp determines the Macaulay and modified duration for a bond whether the first or last coupon
periods in the coupon structure are short or long (that is, whether the coupon structure is
synchronized to maturity). bnddurp also determines the Macaulay and modified duration for a zero
coupon bond.

[ModDuration,YearDuration,PerDuration] = bnddurp( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional
name-value pair arguments.

Examples

Find Bond Duration Given Price

This example shows how to compute the duration of three bonds given their prices.

Price = [106; 100; 98]; 
CouponRate = 0.055; 
Settle = datetime(1999,8,2); 
Maturity = datetime(2004,6,15); 
Period = 2; 
Basis = 0;

[ModDuration, YearDuration, PerDuration] = bnddurp(Price,...
CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis)

ModDuration = 3×1

4.2400
    4.1925
    4.1759

YearDuration = 3×1

4.3275
    4.3077
