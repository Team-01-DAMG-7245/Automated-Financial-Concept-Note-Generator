Efficient Frontier

The efficient frontier is a key concept in modern portfolio theory (MPT) that represents a set of
optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or the lowest risk for a
given level of expected return.

The efficient frontier illustrates the tradeoff between risk (often measured as the standard deviation
of portfolio returns) and expected return. Investors aim to construct portfolios that lie on this frontier
to maximize their returns for a given level of risk. Portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier are
considered optimal because they provide the best possible expected return for their level of risk.
Portfolios that lie below the frontier are suboptimal, as they do not provide sufficient return for the
amount of risk taken. The efficient frontier emphasizes the importance of diversification. By
combining different assets with varying returns and risks, investors can reduce the overall risk of the
portfolio without sacrificing expected returns.
