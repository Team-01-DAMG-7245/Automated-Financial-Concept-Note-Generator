Group Ratio Constraints

Group ratio constraints specify that the total weight or allocation of assets within a particular group
must satisfy certain conditions relative to the total portfolio.

Tips

•
You can also use dot notation to add group ratio constraints for the portfolio weights to existing
group ratio constraints.

obj = obj.addGroupRatio(GroupA, GroupB, LowerRatio, UpperRatio)

•
To remove group ratio constraints from any of the portfolio objects using dot notation, enter empty
arrays for the corresponding arrays.
