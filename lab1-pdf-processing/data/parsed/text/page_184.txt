must be a non-empty compact set, the application of a tracking error constraint may result in an
empty portfolio set. Use estimateBounds to confirm that the portfolio set is non-empty and
compact.

Cardinality Constraints

Cardinality constraint limits the number of assets in the optimal allocation for an Portfolio,
PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object. Use setMinMaxNumAssets to specify the
'MinNumAssets' and 'MaxNumAssets' constraints. To mathematically formulate this type of
constraints, a binary variable vi is needed. vi = 0 indicates that asset i is not selected and vi = 1
indicates that the asset was selected. Thus

MinNumAssets ≤
∑
i = 1

NumAssets
vi ≤MaxNumAssets

The default is to ignore this constraint.
