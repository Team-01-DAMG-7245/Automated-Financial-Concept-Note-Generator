Input Arguments

Data — Data with high, low, open, close information
matrix | table | timetable

Data with high, low, open, close information, specified as a matrix, table, or timetable. For matrix
input, Data is an M-by-4 matrix of high, low, opening, and closing prices. Timetables and tables with M
rows must contain variables named 'High', 'Low', 'Open', and 'Close' (case insensitive).

Data Types: double | table | timetable

Output Arguments

MACDLine — MACD series
matrix | table | timetable

MACD series, returned with the same number of rows (M) and type (matrix, table, or timetable) as the
input Data. The MACDLine is calculated by subtracting the 26-period (7.5%) exponential.

SignalLine — Nine-period exponential series
matrix | table | timetable

Nine-period exponential series, returned with the same number of rows (M) and type (matrix, table, or
timetable) as the input Data. The nine-period (20%) exponential moving average of the MACDLine is
used as the SignalLine.

More About

MACD

The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period (7.5%) exponential moving average from the 12-
period (15%) moving average.

The nine-period (20%) exponential moving average of the MACD line is used as the "signal" line.
When the two lines are plotted, they can give you indications on when to buy or sell a stock, when
overbought or oversold is occurring, and when the end of trend may occur. For example, when the
MACD and the 20-day moving average line have crossed and the MACD line becomes below the other
line, it is time to sell.
