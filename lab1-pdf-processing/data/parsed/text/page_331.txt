Illustrate the Tangent Line to the Efficient Frontier

Tobin's mutual fund theorem (Tobin 1958 on page 4-177) says that the portfolio allocation problem is
viewed as a decision to allocate between a riskless asset and a risky portfolio. In the mean-variance
framework, cash serves as a proxy for a riskless asset and an efficient portfolio on the efficient
frontier serves as the risky portfolio such that any allocation between cash and this portfolio
dominates all other portfolios on the efficient frontier. This portfolio is called a tangency portfolio
because it is located at the point on the efficient frontier where a tangent line that originates at the
riskless asset touches the efficient frontier.

Given that the Portfolio object already has the risk-free rate, obtain the tangent line by creating a
copy of the Portfolio object with a budget constraint that permits allocation between 0% and 100%
in cash. Since the Portfolio object is a value object, it is easy to create a copy by assigning the
output of either Portfolio or the "set" functions to a new instance of the Portfolio object. The
plot shows the efficient frontier with Tobin's allocations that form the tangent line to the efficient
frontier.

q = setBudget(p, 0, 1);

qwgt = estimateFrontier(q,20);
[qrsk,qret] = estimatePortMoments(q,qwgt);

% Plot efficient frontier with tangent line (0 to 1 cash).
