Create roughbergomi Object

The roughbergomi object is a bivariate composite model, composed of two coupled and dissimilar
univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian motion source of risk over NPERIODS
consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time rough stochastic volatility processes.

Create a roughbegomi object.

Return = 0.03;
Alpha = -0.03;
Xi = 0.2;
Eta = 0.015;

roughbergomiObj = roughbergomi(Return,Alpha,Xi,Eta)
