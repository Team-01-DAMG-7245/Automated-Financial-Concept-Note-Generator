cpndatep

Previous coupon date for fixed-income security

Syntax

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(Settle,Maturity)
PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate)

Description

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(Settle,Maturity) returns the previous coupon date on or
before settlement for a portfolio of bonds. This function finds the previous coupon date whether or
not the coupon structure is synchronized with the maturity date. For zero coupon bonds the previous
coupon date is the issue date, if available. However, if the issue date is not supplied, the previous
coupon date for zero coupon bonds is the previous quasi coupon date calculated as if the frequency is
semiannual.

Required input arguments must be number of bonds, NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS, conforming
vectors or scalars.

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate) returns the previous coupon date on or before settlement
for a portfolio of bonds.

Optional input arguments must be either NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS conforming vectors,
scalars, or empty matrices.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then PreviousCouponDate is returned as a serial date
number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted date character
vectors.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then PreviousCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.
