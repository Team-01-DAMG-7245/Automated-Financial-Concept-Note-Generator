LastCouponDate — Irregular or normal last coupon date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Irregular or normal last coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'LastCouponDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or
date character vectors.

If you do not specify a LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, bndkrdur also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

StartDate — Forward starting date of payments
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Forward starting date of payments, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'StartDate' and a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. The StartDate is when a bond actually starts (the date from which a bond cash
flow is considered). To make an instrument forward-starting, specify this date as a future date.

If you do not specify a StartDate, the effective start date is the Settle date.

To support existing code, bndkrdur also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Face — Face value of bond
100 (default) | numeric

Face value of the bond, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Face' and a scalar or a
NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

KeyRateDuration — Key rate durations
matrix

Key rate durations, returned as a numBonds-by-numRates matrix.

More About

Key Rate Duration

Key rate duration is a measure of interest-rate risk that assesses the sensitivity of a bond's price to
changes in interest rates at specific maturities along the yield curve.

Unlike traditional duration measures, which provide a single estimate of price sensitivity to parallel
shifts in interest rates, key rate duration allows investors to understand how changes in interest rates
at different points on the yield curve affect the bond's price.
