Input Arguments

obj — Object for portfolio
object

Object for portfolio, specified using a Portfolio object.

Note The risk-free rate is obtained from the property RiskFreeRate in the Portfolio object. If you
leave the RiskFreeRate unset, it is assumed to be 0. If the max return of portfolio is less than the
RiskFreeRate, the solution is set as pwgt at max return and the resulting Sharpe ratio will be
negative.

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [pwgt,pbuy,psell] = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p,'Method’,'iterative')

Method — Method to estimate Sharpe ratio
'direct' (default) | character vector with value 'direct' or 'iterative'

Method to estimate Sharpe ratio, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Method' and
a character vector with one of the following values:

•
'direct' — Transform the Sharpe ratio function into a quadratic one and solve one optimization
problem directly, instead of iteratively exploring the efficient frontier. The 'direct' option either
uses the solver quadprog (for a problem with linear constraints) or fmincon (for a problem with
nonlinear constraints). For an example of using the 'direct' option, see “Estimate Efficient
Portfolio that Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio for a Portfolio Object Using Solver Options with the
Direct Method” on page 15-988 and “Estimate Efficient Portfolio that Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio
for a Portfolio Object With Tracking Error Using the Direct Method and Solver Options” on page
15-989.

•
'iterative' — One-dimensional optimization using fminbnd to find the portfolio that
maximizes the Sharpe ratio by iteratively exploring the efficient frontier.

Note If you are using estimateMaxSharpeRatio with a Portfolio object with semicontinuous
and cardinality constraints specified by setBounds and setMinMaxNumAssets, you can only use the
'iterative' method.
