sdeld

SDE with Linear Drift (SDELD) model

Description

Creates and displays a SDE object whose drift rate is expressed in linear drift-rate form and that
derives from the sdeddo (SDE from drift and diffusion objects class).

Use sdeld objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables expressed in linear drift-rate
form. They provide a parametric alternative to the mean-reverting drift form (see sdemrd).

These state variables are driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods
consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time stochastic processes with linear
drift-rate functions.

The sdeld object allows you to simulate any vector-valued SDELD of the form:

dXt = (A(t) + B(t)Xt)dt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
A is an NVars-by-1 vector.

•
B is an NVars-by-NVars matrix.

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
corresponding element of the state vector raised to the corresponding power of α.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Creation

Syntax

SDELD = sdeld(A,B,Alpha,Sigma)
SDELD = sdeld( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

SDELD = sdeld(A,B,Alpha,Sigma) creates a default SDELD object.

SDELD = sdeld( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a SDELD object with additional options specified by
one or more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN.
