This function requires that the input mean must satisfy 1 + mg > 0 and that the input covariance Cg
must be a symmetric, positive, semidefinite matrix.

The functions geom2arith and arith2geom are complementary so that, given m, C, and t, the
sequence

[ma,Ca] = geom2arith(m,C,t);
[mg,Cg] = arith2geom(ma,Ca,1/t);

yields mg = m and Cg = C.
