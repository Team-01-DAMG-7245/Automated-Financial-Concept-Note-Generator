If you specify Sigma as a deterministic function of time and state, it must return an NVars-by-
NBrowns matrix when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt

Note Although merton enforces no restrictions for Sigma, volatilities are usually nonnegative.

JumpFreq — Instantaneous jump frequencies representing intensities of Poisson processes
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous jump frequencies representing the intensities (the mean number of jumps per unit
time) of the Poisson processes Nt that drive the jump simulation, specified as an array, a deterministic
function of time, or a deterministic function of time and state.

If you specify JumpFreq as an array, it must be an NJumps-by-1 vector.

If you specify JumpFreq as a deterministic function of time, when you call JumpFreq with a real-
valued scalar time t as its only input, JumpFreq must produce an NJumps-by-1 vector.

If you specify JumpFreq as a deterministic function of time and state, it must return an NVars-by-
NBrowns matrix when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt

JumpMean — Instantaneous mean of random percentage jump sizes
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous mean of random percentage jump sizes J, where log(1+J) is normally distributed with
mean (log(1+JumpMean) - 0.5 × JumpVol2) and standard deviation JumpVol, specified as decimal
using an array, a deterministic function of time, or a deterministic function of time and state. For
instance, an expected jump effect of 20% on the price of an underlying asset must be input as 0.2
instead of 20.

If you specify JumpMean as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NJumps matrix.

If you specify JumpMean as a deterministic function of time, when you cal JumpMean with a real-
valued scalar time t as its only input, it must return an NVars-by-NJumps matrix.

If you specify JumpMean as a deterministic function of time and state, it must return an NVars-by-
NJumps matrix when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt
