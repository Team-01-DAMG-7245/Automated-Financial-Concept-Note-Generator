Create a diffusion Object

Create a diffusion-rate function G:

G = diffusion(1, 0.3)  % Diffusion rate function G(t,X)

G = 
   Class DIFFUSION: Diffusion Rate Specification 
   --------------------------------------------- 
       Rate: diffusion rate function G(t,X(t))  
      Alpha: 1
      Sigma: 0.3

The diffusion object displays like a MATLABÂ® structure and contains supplemental information,
namely, the object's class and a brief description. However, in contrast to the SDE representation, a
summary of the dimensionality of the model does not appear, because the diffusion class creates a
model component rather than a model. G does not contain enough information to characterize the
dimensionality of a problem.

Instance Hierarchy

There are inheritance relationships among the SDE classes.

The following figure illustrates the inheritance relationships.
