The target portfolio that is 30% of the range from minimum to maximum net returns has a return of
7.9% and a risk of 9.1%.

Step 9. Obtaining a Portfolio at the specified risk levels on the efficient frontier.

Although you could accept this result, suppose that you want to target values for portfolio risk.
Specifically, suppose that you have a conservative target risk of 10%, a moderate target risk of 15%,
and an aggressive target risk of 20% and you want to obtain portfolios that satisfy each risk target.
Use the estimateFrontierByRisk function to obtain targeted risks specified in the variable
TargetRisk. The resultant three efficient portfolios are obtained in qwgt.

TargetRisk = [ 0.10; 0.15; 0.20 ];
qwgt = estimateFrontierByRisk(q, TargetRisk);
display(qwgt)

qwgt = 4×3

0.5407    0.2020    0.1500
    0.2332    0.4000    0.0318
    0.0788    0.1280    0.4682
    0.1474    0.2700    0.3500

Use the estimatePortRisk function to compute the portfolio risks for the three portfolios to
confirm that the target risks have been attained:

display(estimatePortRisk(q, qwgt))

0.1000
    0.1500
    0.2000

Suppose that you want to shift from the current portfolio to the moderate portfolio. You can estimate
the purchases and sales to get to this portfolio:

[qwgt, qbuy, qsell] = estimateFrontierByRisk(q, 0.15);

If you average the purchases and sales for this portfolio, you can see that the average turnover is
17%, which is greater than the target of 15%:

disp(sum(qbuy + qsell)/2)

0.1700
