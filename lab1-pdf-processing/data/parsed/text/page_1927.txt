Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Note Any optional input of size N-by-1 is also acceptable as an array of size 1-by-N, or as a single
value applicable to all contracts. Single values are internally expanded to an array of size N-by-1.

Example: [ProbData,HazData] =
cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle,'RecoveryRate',Recovery,'ZeroCompound
ing',-1)

RecoveryRate — Recovery rate
0.4 (default) | decimal

Recovery rate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RecoveryDate' and a N-by-1
vector of recovery rates, specified as a decimal from 0 to 1.

Data Types: double

Period — Premium payment frequency
4 (default) | numeric with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12

Premium payment frequency, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Period' and a N-
by-1 vector with values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.

Data Types: double

Basis — Day-count basis of contract
2 (actual/360) (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Day-count basis of the contract, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Basis' and a
positive integer using a NINST-by-1 vector.
