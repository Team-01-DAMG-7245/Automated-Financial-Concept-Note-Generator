Financial Toolbox Product Description
Analyze financial data and develop financial models

Financial Toolbox provides functions for the mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of
financial data. You can analyze, backtest, and optimize investment portfolios taking into account
turnover, transaction costs, semi-continuous constraints, and minimum or maximum number of
assets. The toolbox enables you to estimate risk, model credit scorecards, analyze yield curves, price
fixed-income instruments and European options, and measure investment performance.

Stochastic differential equation (SDE) tools let you model and simulate a variety of stochastic
processes. Time series analysis functions let you perform transformations or regressions with missing
data and convert between different trading calendars and day-count conventions.
