This scenario is also not correct since the original price timetable (warm-up and test partitions
together) does have enough price history by March 22 to fill out a valid lookback window. However,
the earlier data is not available to the backtest engine because the backtest was run using only the
test partition.

Use Start and End Parameters for runBacktest

The ideal workflow in this situation is to both omit the warm-up data range from the backtest to avoid
the look-ahead bias but include the warm-up data in the price history to be able to fill out the
lookback window of the strategy with all available price history data. You can do so by using the
'Start' parameter for the runBacktest function.

The 'Start' and 'End' name-value pair arguments for runBacktest enable you to start and end
the backtest on specific dates. You can specify 'Start' and 'End' as rows of the prices timetable or
as datetime values (see the documentation for the runBacktest function for details). The 'Start'
argument lets the backtest begin on a particular date while giving the backtest engine access to the
full data set.

Rerun the backtest using the 'Start' name-value pair argument rather than only running on a
partition of the original data set.

% Rerun the backtest starting on the last day of the warmup range.
startRow = warmupRange(end);
backtester = runBacktest(backtester,pricesTT,'Start',startRow);

Plot the new asset area plot.

assetAreaPlot(backtester,"InverseVariance")

View the new rebalance table with the new 'Start' parameter.

printRebalanceTable(ivStrategy,pricesTT,minLookback,startRow);
