•
If StorePaths is true (the default value) or is unspecified, simByEuler returns Paths as a
three-dimensional time-series array.

•
If StorePaths is false (logical 0), simByEuler returns Paths as an empty matrix.

Data Types: logical

MonteCarloMethod — Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes
"standard" (default) | string with values "standard", "quasi", or "randomized-quasi" |
character vector with values 'standard', 'quasi', or 'randomized-quasi'

Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'MonteCarloMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following
values:

•
"standard" — Monte Carlo using pseudo random numbers

•
"quasi" — Quasi-Monte Carlo using low-discrepancy sequences

•
"randomized-quasi" — Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo

Note If you specify an input noise process (see Z and N), simByEuler ignores the value of
MonteCarloMethod.

Data Types: string | char

QuasiSequence — Low discrepancy sequence to drive the stochastic processes
"sobol" (default) | string with value "sobol" | character vector with value 'sobol'

Low discrepancy sequence to drive the stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'QuasiSequence' and a string or character vector with the following value:

•
"sobol" — Quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences that use a base of two to form successively
finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension.

Note If MonteCarloMethod option is not specified or specified as"standard", QuasiSequence is
ignored.

Data Types: string | char

BrownianMotionMethod — Brownian motion construction method
"standard" (default) | string with value "brownian-bridge" or "principal-components" |
character vector with value 'brownian-bridge' or 'principal-components'

Brownian motion construction method, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BrownianMotionMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following values:

•
"standard" — The Brownian motion path is found by taking the cumulative sum of the Gaussian
variates.

•
"brownian-bridge" — The last step of the Brownian motion path is calculated first, followed by
any order between steps until all steps have been determined.

•
"principal-components" — The Brownian motion path is calculated by minimizing the
approximation error.
