PV =
Present value of a cash flow.

CF =
The cash flow amount.

z =
The risk-adjusted annualized rate or yield corresponding to a given cash flow. The
yield is quoted on a semiannual basis.

f =
The frequency of quotes for the yield.

TF =
Time factor for a given cash flow. Time is measured in semiannual periods from
the settlement date to the cash flow date. In computing time factors, use SIA
actual/actual day count conventions for all time factor calculations.

For ICMA conventions, the frequency of annual coupon payments determines bond price and yield.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although bndyield supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.

R2017b: Support for optional name-value input arguments
Behavior changed in R2017b

The specification of optional input arguments has changed. While the previous ordered inputs syntax
is still supported, it may no longer be supported in a future release. Use the optional name-value pair
inputs: Period, Basis, EndMonthRule, IssueDate,FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate,
StartDate,Face, CompoundingFrequency, DiscountBasis, and LastCouponInterest.
