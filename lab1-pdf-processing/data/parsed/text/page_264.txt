whether a collection of portfolios is feasible. Suppose that you perform the following portfolio
optimization and want to determine if the resultant efficient portfolios are feasible relative to a
modified problem.

First, set up a problem in the Portfolio object p, estimate efficient portfolios in pwgt, and then
confirm that these portfolios are feasible relative to the initial problem:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
      0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
      0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
      0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];
 
p = Portfolio;
p = setAssetMoments(p, m, C);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
pwgt = estimateFrontier(p);

checkFeasibility(p, pwgt)

ans =

1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1

Next, set up a different portfolio problem that starts with the initial problem with an additional a
turnover constraint and an equally weighted initial portfolio:

q = setTurnover(p, 0.3, 0.25);
checkFeasibility(q, pwgt)

ans =

0     0     0     1     1     0     0     0     0     0

In this case, only two of the 10 efficient portfolios from the initial problem are feasible relative to the
new problem in Portfolio object q. Solving the second problem using checkFeasibility
demonstrates that the efficient portfolio for Portfolio object q is feasible relative to the initial
problem:

qwgt = estimateFrontier(q);
checkFeasibility(p, qwgt)

ans =

1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1
