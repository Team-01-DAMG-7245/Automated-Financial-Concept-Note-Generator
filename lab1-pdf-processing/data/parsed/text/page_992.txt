Step 2a. Automatically bin the data.

Use the autobinning function to perform automatic binning for every predictor variable, using the
default 'Monotone' algorithm with default algorithm options.

sc = autobinning(sc);

After the automatic binning step, every predictor bin must be reviewed using the bininfo and 
plotbins functions and fine-tuned. A monotonic, ideally linear trend in the Weight of Evidence
(WOE) is desirable for credit scorecards because this translates into linear points for a given
predictor. The WOE trends can be visualized using plotbins.

Predictor = 
;
plotbins(sc,Predictor)

Unlike the initial plot of 'ResStatus' when the scorecard was created, the new plot for
'ResStatus' shows an increasing WOE trend. This is because the autobinning function, by
default, sorts the order of the categories by increasing odds.

These plots show that the 'Monotone' algorithm does a good job finding monotone WOE trends for
this dataset. To complete the binning process, it is necessary to make only a few manual adjustments
for some predictors using the modifybins function.

Step 2b. Fine-tune the bins using manual binning.

Common steps to manually modify bins are:
