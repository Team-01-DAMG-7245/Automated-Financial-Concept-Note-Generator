Introduction

Most models and utilities available with Monte Carlo Simulation of SDEs are represented as MATLAB
objects. Therefore, this documentation often uses the terms model and object interchangeably.

However, although all models are represented as objects, not all objects represent models. In
particular, drift, diffusion objects are used in model specification, but neither of these types of
objects in and of themselves makes up a complete model. Usually, you do not need to create drift,
diffusion objects directly, so you do not need to differentiate between objects and models. It is
important, however, to understand the distinction between these terms.

In many of the following examples, most model parameters are evaluated or invoked like any
MATLAB function. Although it is helpful to examine and access model parameters as you would data
structures, think of these parameters as functions that perform actions.

Creating Objects

For examples and more information on creating SDE objects, see:

•
“Available SDE Models” on page 14-11

•
“Simulating Equity Prices” on page 14-31

•
“Simulating Interest Rates” on page 14-50

Displaying Objects

•
Objects display like traditional MATLAB data structures.

•
Displayed object parameters appear as nouns that begin with capital letters. In contrast,
parameters such as simulate and interpolate appear as verbs that begin with lowercase
letters, which indicate tasks to perform.
