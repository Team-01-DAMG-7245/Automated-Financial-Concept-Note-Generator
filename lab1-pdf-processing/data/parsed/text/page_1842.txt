R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although bndconvy supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.

R2017b: Support for optional name-value input arguments
Behavior changed in R2017b

The specification of optional input arguments has changed. While the previous ordered inputs syntax
is still supported, it may no longer be supported in a future release. Use the optional name-value pair
inputs: Period, Basis, EndMonthRule, IssueDate,FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate,
StartDate,Face, CompoundingFrequency, DiscountBasis, and LastCouponInterest.
