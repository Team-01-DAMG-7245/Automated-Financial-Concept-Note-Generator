From the trend decomposition and by inspecting the series Lt + St for each commodity, you can see
that most commodities show a long-term decrease in price over recent decades, followed by a more
recent upturn in the price.

Some exceptions, such as the series Sugar, EU, show a long-term downward trend.

Some commodities also appear to have gone through periods of high seasonal volatility, such as the
two coffee price series. Banana and orange prices appear to be more susceptible to seasonal
volatility. Chicken prices exhibit seasonal volatility that has increased in the last few years.

Cluster Commodities Based on Similarity in Irregular Component

After removing the long-term and seasonal components from the price series, you are left with the
irregular component Ct, given by

Ct = Pt −Lt −St.

The Ct component represents the business cycle component in the soft commodity time series and
this series is affected by short-term market conditions. This component provides a fairer basis for
comparing the soft commodity prices because both the long-term price trends and the seasonal
trends are removed.

Compute the pairwise distances between the irregular components using the correlation distance
metric d. This metric is defined by

d(s1, s2) = 1 −ρ(s1, s2), where ρ(s1, s2) is the linear correlation coefficient between the two time series
s1 and s2.

irregularCorrDistances = pdist( irregularComponent.', "correlation" );

Use linkage to perform hierarchical clustering using the correlation distances. The complete
method uses the largest distance between commodities in the two clusters.

irregularComponentLinkage = linkage( irregularCorrDistances, "complete" );

Create a dendrogram to visualize the linkage.
