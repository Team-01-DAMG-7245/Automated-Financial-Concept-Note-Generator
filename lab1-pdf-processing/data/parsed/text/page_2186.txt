The data covers the period from January 1, 2000 to November 7, 2005 with daily total returns. Two
stocks in this universe have missing values that are represented by NaNs. One of the two stocks had
an IPO during this period and, consequently, has significantly less data than the other stocks.

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmnmle(Data);

Compute separate regressions for each stock, where the stocks with missing data have estimates that
reflect their reduced observability.
