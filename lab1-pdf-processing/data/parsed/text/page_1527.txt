Initial values of the state variables on all trials, specified as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

•
If StartState is a scalar, roughbergomi applies the same initial value to all state variables on
all trials.

•
If StartState is a 2-by-1 column vector, roughbergomi applies a unique initial value to each
state variable on all trials.

•
If StartState is a 2-by-NTRIALS matrix, roughbergomi applies a unique initial value to each
state variable on each NTRIALS trials.

Note Although no restrictions are enforced, for the rough Bergomi model, the StartState of the
second variable (variance) is expected to always be 1. The initial forward variance value is specified
using Xi.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate bivariate
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
2-by-2 identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) | numeric scalar |
positive semidefinite matrix | deterministic function

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the bivariate Brownian motion
vector (Wiener processes), specified as numeric scalar, a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite matrix, or a
deterministic function C(t) that accepts the current time t and returns a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite
correlation matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use nearcorr to
create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

A Correlation matrix represents a static condition.

As a deterministic function of time, Correlation allows you to specify a dynamic correlation
structure.

Data Types: double

Simulation — User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method
simulation by Euler approximation (simByEuler) (default) | function | SDE simulation method

User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method, specified as a function or SDE simulation
method. The default is simByEuler.

Data Types: function_handle
