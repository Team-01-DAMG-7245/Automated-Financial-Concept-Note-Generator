Using 'fmincon' SolverType

Unlike Optimization Toolbox which uses the 'interior-point' algorithm as the default algorithm
for fmincon, the portfolio optimization for a PortfolioMAD object uses the 'sqp' algorithm as the
default. For details about fmincon and constrained nonlinear optimization algorithms and options,
see “Constrained Nonlinear Optimization Algorithms”.

To modify fmincon options for MAD portfolio optimizations, use setSolver to set the hidden
properties solverType and solverOptions to specify and control the solver. Since these solver
properties are hidden, you cannot set them using the PortfolioMAD object. The default for the
fmincon solver is the 'sqb' algorithm and no displayed output, so you do not need to use
setSolver to specify the 'sqp' algorithm for fmincon.

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setSolver(p, 'fmincon');
display(p.solverOptions.Algorithm)
display(p.solverOptions.Display)

If you want to specify additional options associated with the fmincon solver, setSolver accepts
these options as name-value pair arguments. For example, if you want to use fmincon with the
'active-set' algorithm and with displayed output, use setSolver with:

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setSolver(p, 'fmincon', 'Algorithm', 'active-set', 'Display', 'final');
display(p.solverOptions)
