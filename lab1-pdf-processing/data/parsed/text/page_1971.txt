2 (actual/360) (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

(Optional) Day-count basis for the certificate of deposit, specified as a scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector.
Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cdyield supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)
