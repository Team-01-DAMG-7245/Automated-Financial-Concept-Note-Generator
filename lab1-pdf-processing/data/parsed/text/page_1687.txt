Heston

In the Heston stochastic volatility model, the asset value process and volatility process are defined as

dS(t) = γ(t)S(t)dt +
V(t)S(t)dWS(t)

dV(t) = κ(θ −V(t))dt + σ V(t)dWV(t)

Here:

•
γ is the continuous risk-free rate.

•
θ is a long-term variance level.

•
κ is the mean reversion speed for the variance.

•
σ is the volatility of volatility.

CIR

You can simulate any vector-valued CIR process of the form

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + D(t, Xt

1
2)V(t)dWt

Here:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean reversion speeds (the rate of mean reversion).

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels (long-run mean or level).

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
square root of the corresponding element of the state vector.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Bates

Bates models are bivariate composite models. Each Bates model consists of two coupled univariate
models.

•
A geometric Brownian motion (gbm) model with a stochastic volatility function and jumps that is
expressed as follows.

dX1t = B(t)X1tdt +
X2tX1tdW1t + Y(t)X1tdNt

This model usually corresponds to a price process whose volatility (variance rate) is governed by
the second univariate model.

•
A Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (cir) square root diffusion model that is expressed as follows.

dX2t = S(t)[L(t) −X2t]dt + V(t) X2tdW2t

This model describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled Bates price process.
