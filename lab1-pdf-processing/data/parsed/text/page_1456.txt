In this plot:

•
The solid red and blue dots indicate the simulated states of the bivariate model.

•
The straight lines that connect the solid dots indicate intermediate states that would be obtained
from a deterministic linear interpolation.

•
Open circles indicate interpolated states.

•
Open circles associated with every other interpolated state encircle solid dots associated with the
corresponding simulated state. However, interpolated states at the midpoint of each time
increment typically deviate from the straight line connecting each solid dot.

Simulation of Conditional Gaussian Distributions

You can gain additional insight into the behavior of stochastic interpolation by regarding a Brownian
bridge as a Monte Carlo simulation of a conditional Gaussian distribution. This example examines the
behavior of a Brownian bridge over a single time increment.

Create Subintervals

Divide a single time increment of length dt into 10 subintervals.

mu    = [0.3; 0.4];
sigma = [0.2 -0.1; 0.1 -0.2];
rho   = [1 0.5; 0.5 1];
obj   = bm(mu,sigma,'Correlation',rho);

rng default; % make output reproducible
dt    = 1/250;  % 1 trading day = 1/250 years
[X,T] = simulate(obj,250,'DeltaTime',dt);
