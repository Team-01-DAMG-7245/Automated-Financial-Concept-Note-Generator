Term Structure of Interest Rates

This example shows how to derive and analyze interest-rate curves, including data conversion and
extrapolation, bootstrapping, and interest-rate curve conversions.

One of the first problems in analyzing the term structure of interest rates is dealing with market data
reported in different formats. Treasury bills, for example, are quoted with bid and asked bank-
discount rates. Treasury notes and bonds, on the other hand, are quoted with bid and asked prices
based on $100 face value. To examine the full spectrum of Treasury securities, analysts must convert
data to a single format. Financial Toolbox™ functions ease this conversion. The following code uses
only one security each; analysts often use 30, 100, or more of each.

First, capture Treasury bill quotes and Reasury bond quotes in their reported format.

%        Maturity               Days  Bid     Ask     AskYield
TBill = [datenum('12/26/2000')  53    0.0503  0.0499  0.0510];

%        Coupon   Maturity           Bid       Ask       AskYield
TBond = [0.08875  datenum(2001,11,5) 103+4/32  103+6/32  0.0564];

Note that these quotes are based on a November 3, 2000 settlement date.

Settle = datenum('3-Nov-2000');

Use the tbl2bond to convert the Treasury bill data to Treasury bond format.

TBTBond = tbl2bond(TBill)

TBTBond = 1×5
105 ×

0    7.3085    0.0010    0.0010    0.0000

The second element of TBTBond is the serial date number for December 26, 2000.

Combine short-term (Treasury bill) with long-term (Treasury bond) data to set up the overall term
structure.

TBondsAll = [TBTBond; TBond]

TBondsAll = 2×5
105 ×

0    7.3085    0.0010    0.0010    0.0000
    0.0000    7.3116    0.0010    0.0010    0.0000

Use tr2bonds to convert the bond data into a form ready for the bootstrapping functions. tr2bonds
generates a matrix of bond information sorted by maturity date, plus vectors of prices and yields.

[Bonds, Prices, Yields] = tr2bonds(TBondsAll)

Bonds = 2×6
105 ×
