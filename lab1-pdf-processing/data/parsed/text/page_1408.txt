Moreover, a parameter is identified as a deterministic function of time if the function accepts a scalar
time t as its only input argument. Otherwise, a parameter is assumed to be a function of time t and
state X(t) and is invoked with both input arguments.

GBM = gbm( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a GBM object with additional options specified by one or
more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN

The GBM object has the following “Properties” on page 15-103:

•
StartTime — Initial observation time

•
StartState — Initial state at StartTime

•
Correlation — Access function for the Correlation input, callable as a function of time

•
Drift — Composite drift-rate function, callable as a function of time and state

•
Diffusion — Composite diffusion-rate function, callable as a function of time and state

•
Simulation — A simulation function or method

•
Return — Access function for the input argument Return, callable as a function of time and state

•
Sigma — Access function for the input argument Sigma, callable as a function of time and state

Input Arguments

Return — Return represents the parameter μ
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Return represents the parameter μ, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify Return as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NVars matrix representing the expected
(mean) instantaneous rate of return.

As a deterministic function of time, when Return is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Return must produce an NVars-by-NVars matrix. If you specify Return as a function of time
and state, it must return an NVars-by-NVars matrix when invoked with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Sigma — Sigma represents the parameter V
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Sigma represents the parameter V, specified as an array or a deterministic function of time.

If you specify Sigma as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix of instantaneous volatility
rates or as a deterministic function of time. In this case, each row of Sigma corresponds to a
particular state variable. Each column corresponds to a particular Brownian source of uncertainty,
and associates the magnitude of the exposure of state variables with sources of uncertainty.
