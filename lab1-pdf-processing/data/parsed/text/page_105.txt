At this scale, sharp departures in the imbalance index align with corresponding departures in the
midprice. If the relationship is predictive, meaning imbalances of a certain size forecast future price
movements, then quantifying the relationship can provide statistical arbitrage opportunities.

Plot a histogram of the interarrival times in the LOB.

DT = diff(t); % Interarrival Times
DT.Format = "s";

figure
binEdges = seconds(0.01:0.01:1);
histogram(DT,binEdges)
xlabel("Seconds")
ylabel("Number of Orders")
title("LOB Interarrival Times")

Interarrival times follow the characteristic pattern of a Poisson process.

Compute the average wait time between orders by fitting an exponential distribution to the
interarrival times.

DTAvg = expfit(DT)

DTAvg = duration
   0.040273 sec

Smoothed Data

The raw imbalance series I is erratic. To identify the most significant dynamic shifts, introduce a
degree of smoothing dI, which is the number of backward ticks used to average the raw imbalance
series.
