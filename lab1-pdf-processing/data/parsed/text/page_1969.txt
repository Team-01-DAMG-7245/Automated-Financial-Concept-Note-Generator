cdyield

Yield on certificate of deposit (CD)

Syntax

Yield = cdyield(Price,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate)
Yield = cdyield( ___ ,Basis)

Description

Yield = cdyield(Price,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate) computes the yield to
maturity of a certificate of deposit given its clean price.

cdyield assumes that the certificates of deposit pay interest at maturity. Because of the simple
interest treatment of these securities, this function is best used for short-term maturities (less than 1
year). The default simple interest calculation uses the Basis for the actual/360 convention (2).

Yield = cdyield( ___ ,Basis) adds an optional argument for Basis.

Examples

Compute the Yield to Maturity of a Certificate of Deposit

This example shows how to compute the yield on the certificate of deposit (CD), given a CD with the
following characteristics.

Price      = 101.125;
CouponRate = 0.05;
Settle     = '02-Jan-02';
Maturity   = '31-Mar-02';
IssueDate = '1-Oct-01';

Yield = cdyield(Price, CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, IssueDate)

Yield = 
0.0039

This example shows how to use datetime inputs to compute the yield on the certificate of deposit
(CD), given a CD with the following characteristics.

Price      = 101.125;
CouponRate = 0.05;
Settle     = datetime('02-Jan-02','Locale','en_US');
Maturity   = datetime('31-Mar-02','Locale','en_US');
