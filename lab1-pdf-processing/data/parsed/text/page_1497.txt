Bates stochastic volatility model

Description

The bates function creates a bates object, which represents a Bates model.

The Bates model is a bivariate composite model that derives from the heston object. The Bates
model is composed of two coupled and dissimilar univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian
motion source of risk and a single compound Poisson process representing the arrivals of important
events over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The Bates model approximates continuous-
time Bates stochastic volatility processes.

The first univariate model is a GBM model with a stochastic volatility function and a stochastic jump
process, and usually corresponds to a price process whose variance rate is governed by the second
univariate model. The second model is a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) square root diffusion model that
describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled GBM price process.

Bates models are bivariate composite models. Each Bates model consists of two coupled univariate
models:

•
A geometric Brownian motion (gbm) model with a stochastic volatility function and jumps.

dX1t = B(t)X1tdt +
X2tX1tdW1t + Y(t)X1tdNt

This model usually corresponds to a price process whose volatility (variance rate) is governed by
the second univariate model.

•
A Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (cir) square root diffusion model.

dX2t = S(t)[L(t) −X2t]dt + V(t) X2tdW2t

This model describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled Bates price process.

Syntax

Bates = bates( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Bates = bates(Return,Speed,Level,Volatility,JumpFreq,JumpMean,JumpVol) create a
bates object with the default options.

Since Bates models are bivariate models composed of coupled univariate models, all required inputs
correspond to scalar parameters. Specify the required inputs as one of two types:
