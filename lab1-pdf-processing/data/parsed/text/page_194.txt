The first condition is satisfied by setting the properties associated with the moments of asset
returns.

•
The set of feasible portfolios must be a nonempty compact set, where a compact set is closed and
bounded.

The second condition is satisfied by an extensive collection of properties that define different types
of constraints to form a set of feasible portfolios. Since such sets must be bounded, either explicit
or implicit constraints can be imposed, and several functions, such as estimateBounds, provide
ways to ensure that your problem is properly formulated.

Although the general sufficiency conditions for mean-variance portfolio optimization go beyond these
two conditions, the Portfolio object implemented in Financial Toolbox implicitly handles all these
additional conditions. For more information on the Markowitz model for mean-variance portfolio
optimization, see “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5.

Portfolio Function Examples

If you create a Portfolio object, p, with no input arguments, you can display it using disp:

p = Portfolio;
disp(p)
