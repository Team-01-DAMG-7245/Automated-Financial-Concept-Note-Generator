Pass the drift and diffusion objects to sdeddo.

SDEDDO = sdeddo(F, G, 'Correlation', correlation, ...
'StartState', 100)

The sdeddo object requires two input objects that provide more information than the two functions
from step 4 of “Represent Market Models Using SDE Models” on page 14-31. Thus, the
dimensionality is more easily resolved. In fact, the initial price of each index is as a scalar
(StartState = 100). This is in contrast to the sde object, which required an explicit state vector to
uniquely determine the dimensionality of the problem.

Once again, the class of each object is clearly identified, and parameters display like fields of a
structure. In particular, the Rate parameter of drift and diffusion objects is identified as a callable
function of time and state, F t, Xt and G t, Xt , respectively. The additional parameters, A, B, Alpha,
and Sigma, are arrays of appropriate dimension, indicating static (non-time-varying) parameters. In
other words, A t, Xt , B t, Xt , Alpha t, Xt , and Sigma t, Xt are constant functions of time and state.
