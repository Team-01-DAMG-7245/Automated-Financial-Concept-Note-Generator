Use simByEuler to simulate NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The
function simByEuler approximates a continuous-time stochastic process by the Euler approach.

NPeriods = 2;
[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler(rvmObj,NPeriods)

Paths = 3×2

1.0000    1.0000
    1.0700    1.4352
    0.0154    1.7045

Times = 3×1

Z = 2×2

0.5377    1.8339
   -2.2588    0.8622

Paths is a 3-by-2 matrix and the output Z is a matrix used to generate the Brownian motion vector.

Simulate Rough Bergomi Model Sample Paths by Euler Approximation

The rough Bergomi model is a roughbergomi object that is a bivariate composite model, composed
of two coupled and dissimilar univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian motion source of
risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time rough
stochastic volatility processes.

Create an roughbergomi object.

Return = 0.03;
Alpha = -0.03;
Xi = 0.2;
Eta = 0.015;

roughbergomiObj = roughbergomi(Return,Alpha,Xi,Eta)

roughbergomiObj =
