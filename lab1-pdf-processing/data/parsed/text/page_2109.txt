datefind

Indices of dates in matrix

Syntax

Indices = datefind(Subset,Superset)
Indices = datefind( ___ ,Tolerance)

Description

Indices = datefind(Subset,Superset) returns a vector of indices to the date numbers in
Superset that are present in Subset. If no date numbers match, Indices = [].

Indices = datefind( ___ ,Tolerance) returns a vector of indices to the date numbers in
Superset that are present in Subset, plus the optional argument for Tolerance. If no date
numbers match, Indices = [].

Examples

Return a Vector of Indices to Date Numbers

This example shows how to return a vector of indices to date numbers.

Superset = datetime(1999,7,1:31); 
Subset = [datetime(1999,7,10) ; datetime(1999,7,20)]; 
Indices = datefind(Subset, Superset, 1)

Indices = 6×1

    10
    11

    20
    21

Input Arguments

Subset — Subset of dates to find matching dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Subset of dates to find matching dates in Superset, specified as a matrix using a datetime array,
string array, or date character vectors.

Subset and Superset can be either be a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.
These types do not have to match. datefind determines the underlying date to match dates of
different data types.
