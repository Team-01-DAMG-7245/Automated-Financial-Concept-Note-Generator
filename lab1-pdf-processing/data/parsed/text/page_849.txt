Working with Linear Inequality Constraints Using PortfolioMAD
Object

Linear inequality constraints are optional linear constraints that impose systems of inequalities on
portfolio weights (see “Linear Inequality Constraints” on page 6-8). Linear inequality constraints have
properties AInequality for the inequality constraint matrix, and bInequality for the inequality
constraint vector.

Setting Linear Inequality Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD Function

The properties for linear inequality constraints are set using the PortfolioMAD object. Suppose that
you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets are no more than
50% of your portfolio. To set up these constraints:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD('AInequality', A, 'bInequality', b);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.AInequality)
disp(p.bInequality)

Setting Linear Inequality Constraints Using the setInequality and
addInequality Functions

You can also set the properties for linear inequality constraints using setInequality. Suppose that
you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets constitute no
more than 50% of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use setInequality to set the
linear inequality constraints:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setInequality(p, A, b);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.AInequality)
disp(p.bInequality)

Suppose that you want to add another linear inequality constraint to ensure that the last three assets
constitute at least 50% of your portfolio. You can set up an augmented system of linear inequalities or
use the addInequality function to build up linear inequality constraints. For this example, create
another system of inequalities:
