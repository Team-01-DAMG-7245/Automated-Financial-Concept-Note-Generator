Data Types: double

ZeroBasis — Basis of the zero curve
0 (actual/actual) (default) | integer with value of 0 to 13

Basis of the zero curve, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ZeroBasis' and an
integer with values that are identical to Basis.

Data Types: double

ProbDates — Dates for probability data
column of dates in MarketData (default) | datetime array | string array | date character vector

Dates for probability data, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ProbDates' and a
P-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, cdsbootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

ProbData — Default probability values
matrix

Default probability values, returned as a P-by-2 matrix with dates and corresponding cumulative
default probability values. The dates match those in MarketData, unless the optional input
parameter ProbDates is provided.

HazData — Hazard rate values
matrix

Hazard rate values, returned as a N-by-2 matrix with dates and corresponding hazard rate values for
the survival probability model. The dates match those in MarketData.

Note A warning is displayed when non-monotone default probabilities (that is, negative hazard rates)
are found.
