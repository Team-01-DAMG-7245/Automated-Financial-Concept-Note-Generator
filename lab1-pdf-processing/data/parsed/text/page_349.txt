with the desired mean and covariance. Specifically, portsim is used to simulate five years of monthly
total returns and then plotted to show the log of the simulated total return prices.

The mean and covariance of annual asset total returns are maintained in the variables AssetMean
and AssetCovar. The simulated asset total return prices (which are compounded total returns) are
maintained in the variable Y. All initial asset total return prices are normalized to 1 in this example.

AssetMean = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
AssetCovar = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
    0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
    0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
    0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

X = portsim(AssetMean'/12, AssetCovar/12, 60); % Monthly total returns for 5 years (60 months)
[Y, T] = ret2tick(X, [], 1/12);                % form total return prices.
plot(T, log(Y));

Step 3. Setting up the Portfolio object.

To explore portfolios on the efficient frontier, set up a Portfolio object using these specifications:

•
Portfolio weights are nonnegative and sum to 1.

•
Equity allocation is no more than 85% of the portfolio.

•
Emerging equity is no more than 35% of the portfolio.

These specifications are incorporated into the Portfolio object p in the following sequence of using
functions that starts with using the Portfolio object.
