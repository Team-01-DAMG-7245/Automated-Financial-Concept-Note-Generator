Optimize Asset Allocation Using Factor Modeling

For factor modeling, you can use statistical factors extracted from the asset return series. In this
example, PCA is used to extract these factors [1 on page 4-399]. You can then use this factor model to
solve the portfolio optimization problem.

With a factor model, n asset returns can be expressed as a linear combination of k factor returns,
ra = μa + F rf + εa , where k ≪p. In the mean-variance framework, portfolio risk is

Var Rp = Var raTwa = Var μa + F rf + εa

Twa = waT FΣfFT + D wa,

where:

•
Rp is the portfolio return (a scalar).

•
ra is the asset returns.

•
μa  is the mean of asset returns.

•
F is the factor loading, with dimension n × k.

•
rf is the factor return.

•
εa is the idiosyncratic return related to each asset.

•
wa is the asset weight.

•
Σf is the covariance of factor returns.

•
D is the variance of idiosyncratic returns.

The parameters ra, wa, μa and εa are n × 1 column vectors, rfand wf are k × 1 column vectors, and Σk
and D are a k × k and a n × n matrices, respectively.

Therefore, the mean-variance optimization problem is formulated as

max
wa
μaTwa

s . t . waT FΣfFT + D wa ≤τ,

∑
a ∈A
wa = 1,

0 ≤wa ≤1 .
