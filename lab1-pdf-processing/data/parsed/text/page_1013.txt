Significance Bootstrapping

For the unconstrained problem, standard formulas are available for computing p-values, which you
use to evaluate which coefficients are significant and which are to be rejected. However, for the
constrained problem, standard formulas are not available, and the derivation of formulas for
significance analysis is complicated. A practical alternative is to perform significance analysis
through bootstrapping.

In the bootstrapping approach, when using fitConstrainedModel, you set the name-value
argument 'Bootstrap' to true and chose a value for the name-value argument
'BootstrapIter'. Bootstrapping means that NIter samples (with replacement) from the original
observations are selected. In each iteration, fitConstrainedModel solves for the same constrained
problem as the "Constrained Model" section. fitConstrainedModel obtains several values
(solutions) for each coefficient bi and you can plot these as a boxplot or histogram. Using the
boxplot or histogram, you can examine the median values to evaluate whether the coefficients are
away from zero and how much the coefficients deviate from their means.

lb = [-Inf;zeros(K,1)];
ub = [Inf;ones(K,1)];
AIneq = [0 -1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0;0 1 0 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0];
bIneq = [0.05;0.05];
c0 = zeros(K,1);
NIter = 100;
Options = optimoptions('fmincon','SpecifyObjectiveGradient',true,'Display','off');
rng('default')

[sc,mdl] = fitConstrainedModel(sc,'AInequality',AIneq,'bInequality',bIneq,...
    'LowerBound',lb,'UpperBound',ub,'Bootstrap',true,'BootstrapIter',NIter,'Options',Options);
