Portfolios with Missing Data

This example shows how to use the missing data algorithms for portfolio optimization and for
valuation. This example works with five years of daily total return data for 12 computer technology
stocks, with six hardware and six software companies. The example estimates the mean and
covariance matrix for these stocks, forms efficient frontiers with both a naïve approach and the ECM
approach, and then compares results.

This data file contains these three quantities:

•
Assets is a cell array of the tickers for the 12 stocks in the example.

•
Data is a 1254-by-12 matrix of 1254 daily total returns for each of the 12 stocks.

•
Dates is a 1254-by-1 column vector of the dates associated with the data.

The time period for the data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

A naïve approach to the estimation of the mean and covariance for these 12 assets is to eliminate all
days that have missing values for any of the 12 assets. Use the function ecmninit with the
'nanskip' option to do this.

[NaNMean, NaNCovar] = ecmninit(Data,'nanskip');

Contrast the result of this approach with using all available data and the function ecmnmle to
compute the mean and covariance. First, call ecmnmle with no output arguments to establish that
enough data is available to obtain meaningful estimates.

ecmnmle(Data);
