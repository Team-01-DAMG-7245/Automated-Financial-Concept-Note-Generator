Obtain Equality Constraints for a PortfolioMAD Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets are 50%
of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, set the linear equality constraints and obtain the
values for AEquality and bEquality:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setEquality(p, A, b);
[AEquality, bEquality] = getEquality(p)

AEquality = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

bEquality = 
0.5000
