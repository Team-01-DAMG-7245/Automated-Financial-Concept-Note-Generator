frontier and estimate either risk or return proxies for efficient portfolios on the efficient frontier. You
can use the resultant efficient portfolios or risk and return proxies in subsequent analyses.

Arrays of Portfolio Objects

Although all functions associated with a Portfolio object are designed to work on a scalar
Portfolio object, the array capabilities of MATLAB enable you to set up and work with arrays of
Portfolio objects. The easiest way to do this is with the repmat function. For example, to create a
3-by-2 array of Portfolio objects:

p = repmat(Portfolio, 3, 2);
disp(p)

disp(p)
  3Ã—2 Portfolio array with properties:

BuyCost
    SellCost
    RiskFreeRate
    AssetMean
    AssetCovar
    TrackingError
    TrackingPort
    Turnover
    BuyTurnover
    SellTurnover
    Name
    NumAssets
    AssetList
    InitPort
    AInequality
    bInequality
    AEquality
    bEquality
    LowerBound
    UpperBound
    LowerBudget
    UpperBudget
    GroupMatrix
    LowerGroup
    UpperGroup
    GroupA
    GroupB
    LowerRatio
    UpperRatio
    MinNumAssets
    MaxNumAssets
    ConditionalBudgetThreshold
    ConditionalUpperBudget
    BoundType

After setting up an array of Portfolio objects, you can work on individual Portfolio objects in the
array by indexing. For example:

p(i,j) = Portfolio(p(i,j), ... );

This example calls Portfolio for the (i,j) element of a matrix of Portfolio objects in the variable
p.
