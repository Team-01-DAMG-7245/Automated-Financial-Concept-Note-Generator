Compute Initial Weights

By default, the initial weights allocate all capital to cash. To avoid this, the first two months (January
and February) of the data are used to estimate the initial weights for the different strategies.

t0 = datetime(2006,1,1);
tEnd = datetime(2006,2,28);
warmupPeriod = t0:tEnd;

You calculate the initial weights by calling the backtestStrategy rebalance functions with only the
dates in January and February.

% No current weights (100% cash position).
numAssets = size(pricesTT,2);
current_weights = zeros(1,numAssets);

% Warm-up partition of data set timetable.
warmupTT = pricesTT(warmupPeriod,:);

% Compute the initial portfolio weights for each strategy.
equalWeight_initial     = equalWeightFcn(current_weights,warmupTT);
maxSharpeRatio_initial  = maxSharpeRatioFcn(current_weights,warmupTT);

Visualize the initial weight allocations from the strategies.

strategyNames = {'Equally Weighted', 'Max Sharpe Ratio'};
assetSymbols = pricesTT.Properties.VariableNames;
initialWeights = [equalWeight_initial(:), maxSharpeRatio_initial(:)];
bar(assetSymbols,initialWeights);
