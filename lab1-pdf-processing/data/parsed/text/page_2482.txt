MaxDD50Ret = 
0.1658

Next, compute the maximum drop in value, using the 'arithmetic' argument.

[MaxDD50Arith, Ind50Arith] = maxdrawdown(Fund50,'arithmetic')

MaxDD50Arith = 
8.4285

Ind50Arith = 2×1

    18

The value of this investment was $50.84 in month 2, but by month 18 the value was down to $42.41, a
drop of $8.43. This is the largest loss in dollar value from a previous high in the given time period. In
this case, the maximum drawdown period, from the 2nd to 18th month, is the same independently of
whether drawdown is measured as return or as dollar value loss.

[MaxDD50LogRet, Ind50LogRet] = maxdrawdown(Fund50,'geometric')

MaxDD50LogRet = 
0.1813

Ind50LogRet = 2×1

2
    18

Note, the last measure is equivalent to finding the arithmetic maximum drawdown for the log of the
series.

MaxDD50LogRet2 = maxdrawdown(log(Fund50),'arithmetic')

MaxDD50LogRet2 = 
0.1813
