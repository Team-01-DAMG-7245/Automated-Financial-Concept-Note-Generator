The weights associated with the mean-variance portfolios on the efficient frontier use only two
strategies, 'Stock' and 'Hedge95'. This behavior is an effect of the correlations among the five
assets in the portfolio. Because the correlations between the assets are close to 1, the standard
deviation of the portfolio is almost a linear combination of the standard deviation of the assets.
Hence, because assets with larger returns are associated with assets with larger variance, a linear
combination of only the assets with the smallest and largest returns is observed in the efficient
frontier.
