Input Arguments

Data — Data
matrix

Data, specified as an NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMSERIES matrix with NUMSAMPLES samples of a NUMSERIES-
dimensional random vector. Missing values are indicated by NaNs. Only samples that are entirely
NaNs are ignored. (To ignore samples with at least one NaN, use mvnrmle.)

Data Types: double

Design — Design model
matrix | cell array

Design model, specified as a matrix or a cell array that handles two model structures:

•
If NUMSERIES = 1, Design is a NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix with known values. This
structure is the standard form for regression on a single series.

•
If NUMSERIES ≥ 1, Design is a cell array. The cell array contains either one or NUMSAMPLES cells.
Each cell contains a NUMSERIES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix of known values.

If Design has a single cell, it is assumed to have the same Design matrix for each sample. If
Design has more than one cell, each cell contains a Design matrix for each sample.

Data Types: double | cell

MaxIterations — Maximum number of iterations for the estimation algorithm
100 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Maximum number of iterations for the estimation algorithm, specified as a numeric.
