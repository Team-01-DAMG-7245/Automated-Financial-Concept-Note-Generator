Cash Flow Convexity

Cash flow convexity is a financial metric that measures the sensitivity of the cash flows from an
investment to changes in interest rates, specifically focusing on how the present value of those cash
flows changes as interest rates fluctuate.

Understanding cash flow convexity helps investors assess the risk associated with interest-rate
movements. Higher convexity indicates that the cash flows will be less sensitive to interest-rate
changes, which can be beneficial in volatile interest-rate environments. Cash flow convexity provides
a more comprehensive measure of interest-rate risk than duration alone, as duration only captures
the linear relationship between price and yield.
