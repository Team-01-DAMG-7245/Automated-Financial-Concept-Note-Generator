Portfolio Optimization Using Social Performance Measure

Use a Portfolio object to minimize the variance, maximize return, and maximize the average
percentage of women on a company's board. The same workflow can be applied with other
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria, such as an ESG score, a climate, or a
temperature score.

The goal of this example is to find portfolios that are efficient in the sense that they minimize the
variance, maximize return, and maximize the average percentage of women on the board of directors.
To find the average percentage of women on a company's board (WoB) for a given portfolio, this
example uses a weighted sum of the percentages of WoB for each individual asset, where the weights
are given by the amount invested in each asset for the portfolio. By defining the average percentage
of WoB this way, the WoB function is linear with respect to the weights.

% Assume that the percentage of women on the board of directors per
% company are as follows:
WoB = [0.2857; 0.5; 0.3; 0.2857; 0.3077; 0.2727; ...
    0.4167; 0.2143; 0.3; 0.4167; 0.3077];

Create Portfolio Object

Create a standard Portfolio object and incorporate the list of assets and estimate the moments of
the assets' returns from the data. Use setDefaultConstraints to set the default mean-variance
portfolio constraints. These constraints require fully invested, long-only portfolios where the
nonnegative weights must sum to 1.

% Create portfolio with default constraints.
p = Portfolio('AssetList',Assets(1:11));
p = estimateAssetMoments(p, Data(:,1:11));
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
