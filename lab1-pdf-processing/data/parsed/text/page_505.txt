Comparable to the two diversification measures above, here the penalized strategy weights are
between the minimum variance portfolio and the ERC portfolio. Choosing λERC = 0 returns the

minimum variance solution and the values of λERC ∈0, λERC  return asset weights that range from

the minimum variance behavior to the ERC portfolio behavior.

Compute the number of assets that are selected in each portfolio. Assume that an asset is selected if
the weight associated to that asset is above a certain threshold.

As discussed above, the HH penalty goal is to obtain more evenly weighted portfolios. The portfolio
that maximizes the HH diversity (and corresponds to the EW portfolio when only the default
constraints are selected) has the largest number of assets selected and the weights of these assets
are closer together. You can see this latter quality in the following boxchart. Also, the strategy that
