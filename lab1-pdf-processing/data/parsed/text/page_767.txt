Mixed-Integer CVaR Portfolio Optimization Problem

This example shows how to solve a CVaR portfolio optimization problem with constraints in the
number of selected assets or conditional (semicontinuous) bounds. To solve this problem, you can use
a PortfolioCVaR object along with different mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
solvers.

CVaR Portfolio

Load the returns data in CAPMuniverse.mat. Then, create a PortfolioCVaR object with default
constraints and a long-only portfolio whose weights sum to 1. For this example, you can define the
feasible region of weights X as

X =
x| ∑
i = 1

n
xi = 1, xi ≥0 .

% Load data
load CAPMuniverse.mat

% Create portfolio with default constraints
p = PortfolioCVaR(ProbabilityLevel=0.95);
p = simulateNormalScenariosByData(p,Data(:,1:12),1000,missingdata=true);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

Include binary variables for this scenario by setting conditional (semicontinuous) bounds. Conditional
bounds are those such that xi = 0 or xi ≥ℓi. In this example, ℓi = 0 . 1 for all assets.

% Set conditional bounds
condLB = 0.1;
condUB = 0.5;
p = setBounds(p,condLB,condUB,BoundType="conditional");

Use estimateFrontier to estimate a set of portfolios on the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier
is a curve that shows the trade-off between the return and risk achieved by Pareto-optimal portfolios.
For a given return level, the portfolio on the efficient frontier is the one that minimizes the risk while
maintaining the desired return. Conversely, for a given risk level, the portfolio on the efficient frontier
is the one that maximizes return while maintaining the desired risk level.

% Compute efficient frontier
p = setSolverMINLP(p,'TrustRegionCP',DeltaLowerBound=condLB);
pwgt = estimateFrontier(p)

pwgt = 12×10
