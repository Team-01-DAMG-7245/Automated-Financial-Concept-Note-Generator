The missing bin can be left as is, although a common alternative is to treat the missing values. Note
that treating the missing values must be done with care because it changes the data and can
introduce bias.

To treat missing values, you can apply different criteria. This example follows a straightforward
approach to replace missing observations with the most common or typical value in the data
distribution, which is the value of mode for the data. For this example, the mode happens to have a
similar WOE value as the original <missing> bin. The similarity in values is favorable because
similar WOE values means similar points in a scorecard.

For CustAge, bin 4 is the bin with the most observations and the mode value of the original data is
43.

modeCustAge = mode(dataMissing.CustAge);
disp(modeCustAge)

43

The WOE value of the <missing> bin is similar to the WOE value of bin 4. Therefore, replacing the
missing values in CustAge with the value of mode is reasonable.

To treat the data, create a copy of the data and fill the missing values.

dataTreated = dataMissing;
dataTreated.CustAge = fillmissing(dataTreated.CustAge,'constant',modeCustAge);
