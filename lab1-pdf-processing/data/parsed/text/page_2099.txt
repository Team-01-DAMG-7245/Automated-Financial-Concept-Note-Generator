date2time

Time and frequency from dates

Syntax

[TFactors,F] = date2time(Settle,Maturity)
[TFactors,F] = date2time( ___ ,Compounding,Basis,EndMonthRule)

Description

[TFactors,F] = date2time(Settle,Maturity) computes time factors appropriate to
compounded rate quotes between the Settle and Maturity dates. date2time is the inverse of
time2date.

[TFactors,F] = date2time( ___ ,Compounding,Basis,EndMonthRule) computes time
factors appropriate to compounded rate quotes between the Settle and Maturity dates using
optional input arguments for Compounding, Basis, and EndMonthRule. date2time is the inverse
of time2date.

Examples

Compute date2time Using an actual/actual Basis

To get the date2time period between '31-Jul-2015' and '30-Sep-2015' using an actual/actual basis:

date2time(datetime(2015,7,31),datetime(2015,9,30), 2, 0, 1)

ans = 
0.3333

When using date2time quasi coupon, two quasi coupon dates are computed for a bond with a
maturity corresponding to the Dates input. In this case, that would be "30-Sep-2015". Assuming that
the compounding frequency is 2, the other quasi coupon date is six months prior to this date.
Assuming the end of month rule is in place, then the other quasi coupon date is "31-Mar-2015". You
can use these two dates to compute the total number of actual days in a period (which is 183). Given
this, the fraction of time between the start and end date for the actual/actual basis is computed as
follows.

(Actual Days between Start Date and End Date)/(Actual Number of Days between
Quasi Coupon Dates)

There are 61 days between 31-Jul-2015 and 30-Sep-2015 and 183 days between the quasi coupon
dates ("31-Mar-2015" and "30-Sep-2015") which leads to a final result of 61/183 or exactly 1/3.
