Compute the dollar durations for each of the instruments and each of the key rates (assuming holding
100 bonds).

PortfolioDD = 100*Price* BondKRD;
HedgeDD = HedgeKRD.*[Price_30;Price_10;Price_05;Price_02]

HedgeDD = 4×4
103 ×

0.2453         0         0         0
    0.0139    0.5047         0         0
    0.0216    0.0745    0.7525         0
    0.0224    0.0713    0.2164    1.4622

Compute the number of bonds to sell short to obtain a key rate duration that is 0 for the entire
portfolio.

NumBonds = PortfolioDD/HedgeDD

NumBonds = 1×4

3.8973    6.1596   23.0282   80.0522

These results indicate selling 4, 6, 23 and 80 bonds respectively of the 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year bonds
achieves a portfolio that is neutral with respect to the 2-, 5-, 10-, and 30-year spot rates.
