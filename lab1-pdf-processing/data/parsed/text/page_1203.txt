F(t, Xt) = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]
 (14-3)

where S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix-valued function of mean reversion speeds (that is, rates of mean
reversion), and L is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function of mean reversion levels (that is, long run
average level).

Similarly, consider the following diffusion-rate specification:

G(t, Xt) = D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)
 (14-4)

where D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix-valued function. Each diagonal element of D is the
corresponding element of the state vector raised to the corresponding element of an exponent Alpha,
which is also an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function. V is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued function
of instantaneous volatility rates. Each row of V corresponds to a particular state variable, and each
column corresponds to a particular Brownian source of uncertainty. V associates the exposure of state
variables with sources of risk.

The parametric specifications for the drift and diffusion-rate functions associate parametric
restrictions with familiar models derived from the general SDE class, and provide coverage for many
models.

The class system and hierarchy of the SDE engine use industry-standard terminology to provide
simplified interfaces for many models by placing user-transparent restrictions on drift and diffusion
specifications. This design allows you to mix and match existing models, and customize drift-rate or
diffusion-rate functions.

Available SDE Models

For example, the following models are special cases of the general SDE model.
