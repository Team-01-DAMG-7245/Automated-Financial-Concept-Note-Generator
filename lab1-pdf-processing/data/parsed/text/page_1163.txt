To estimate the tails of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) using EVT, you must standardize
the residuals by their corresponding conditional standard deviation. These standardized residuals
represent a series that is zero-mean, unit-variance, and approximately independent and identically
distributed. The EVT estimation of the sample CDF tails is based on this standardized residual series:

residuals = residuals ./ sqrt(variances);

Use autocorr (Econometrics Toolbox) to analyze the autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of the
standardized residuals and squared standardized residuals. By comparing these ACFs to the ACFs of
the raw returns, you can observe that the standardized residuals exhibit a closer approximation to the
iid assumption. The standardized residuals are more suitable for subsequent tail estimation purposes.
