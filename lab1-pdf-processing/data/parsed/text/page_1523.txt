Algorithms

The rough volatility model (RVM) model allows you to simulate any vector-valued RVM of the form:

dX1t = B(t)X1tdt + X2tX1tdW1t

X2t = ξeYt

Yt =∫−∞

t
g(t −s)νsdWs

The first equation is a geometric Brownian motion model with a stochastic volatility function.

The second equation is the process describing the evolution of the volatility rate of the coupled GBM
process, where Yt is a Brownian semistationary process.

g(t) is called a kernel function, which has the following properties:

•
For some α ∈( −1
2, 1
2)\ 0 , x ∈(0, 1) and L0, there is a continuously differentiable, bounded away

from zero, slowly varying function at zero: g(x) = xαL0(x), where ɑ = H -1/2 and H is a Hurst
exponent.
