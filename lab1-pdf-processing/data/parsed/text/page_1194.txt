SDE Modeling

Financial Toolbox enables you to model dependent financial and economic variables, such as interest
rates and equity prices, by performing standard Monte Carlo or Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation of
stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The flexible architecture of the SDE engine provides efficient
simulation methods that allow you to create new simulation and derivative pricing methods.

The following table lists tasks you can perform using the SDE functionality.
