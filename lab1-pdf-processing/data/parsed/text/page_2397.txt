getEquality

Obtain equality constraint arrays from portfolio object

Syntax

[AEquality,bEquality] = getEquality(obj)

Description

Use the getEquality function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain equality constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[AEquality,bEquality] = getEquality(obj) obtains equality constraint arrays from portfolio
objects.

Examples

Obtain Equality Constraints for a Portfolio Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets are
exactly 50% of your portfolio. Given a Portfolio object p, set the linear equality constraints and obtain
the values for AEquality and bEquality:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = Portfolio;
p = setEquality(p, A, b);
[AEquality, bEquality] = getEquality(p)

AEquality = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

bEquality = 
0.5000

Obtain Equality Constraints for a PortfolioCVaR Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets are 50%
of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioCVaR object p, set the linear equality constraints and obtain the
values for AEquality and bEquality:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
