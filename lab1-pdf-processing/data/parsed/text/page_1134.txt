Optimize Asset Allocation Using Portfolio Object

Asset allocation is optimized using a Portfolio object. Ten optimal portfolios (NumPorts) are
calculated using estimateFrontier and their Sharpe ratios are calculated. The optimal portfolio,
based on investor preference, is chosen to be the one that is closest to the maximum value of the
Sharpe ratio.

Create a Portfolio object using Portfolio. You can use setAssetMoments to set moments
(mean and covariance) of asset returns for the Portfolio object and setDefaultConstraints to
set up the portfolio constraints with nonnegative weights that sum to 1.

% Create a portfolio object.
p = Portfolio;
p = setAssetMoments(p,retsMean,retsCov);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p)

p = 
  Portfolio with properties:

BuyCost: []
                      SellCost: []
                  RiskFreeRate: []
