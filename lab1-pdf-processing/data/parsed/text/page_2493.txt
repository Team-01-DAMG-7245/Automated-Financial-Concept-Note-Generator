To compute moving average with custom weights, the weights (w) are first normalized such that they
sum to one:

W(i) = w(i)/sum(w), for i = 1,2,...,N

The normalized weights (W) are then used to form the N-point weighted moving average (y) of the
input Data (x):

y(t) = W(1)*x(t) + W(2)*x(t-1) + ... + W(N)*x(t-N)

The initial moving average values within the window size are then adjusted according to the method
specified in the name-value pair argument initialPoints.

Data Types: double

initialPoints — Indicates how moving average is calculated at initial points
'shrink' (default) | character vector with values of 'shrink', 'fill', or 'zero' | string with
values of "shrink", "fill", or "zero"

(Optional) Indicates how the moving average is calculated at initial points (before there is enough
data to fill the window), specified as a character vector or string using one of the following values:

•
'shrink' - Initializes the moving average such that the initial points include only observed data

•
'zero' - Initializes the initial points with 0

•
'fill' - Fills initial points with NaNs

Note The initialPoints argument applies to all type specifications except for the
'exponential' and 'modified' options.

Data Types: char | string

Output Arguments

ma — Moving average series
matrix | table | timetable

Moving average series, returned with the same number of rows (M) and the same type (matrix, table,
or timetable) as the input Data.

More About

Moving Average

A moving average is a statistical calculation used to analyze data points by creating averages of
different subsets of the complete data set.

Moving averages are commonly used to smooth out price data over a specified period, helping to
identify trends and reduce noise in price movements.
