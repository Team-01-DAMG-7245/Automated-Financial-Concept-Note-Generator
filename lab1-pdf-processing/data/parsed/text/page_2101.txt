Basis — Day-count basis
0 (actual/actual) (default) | numeric with value 0 through 13 | vector of numerics with values 0
through 13

Day-count basis, specified as an integer with a value 0 through 13 or a N-by-1 vector of integers with
values 0 through 13.

•
0 = actual/actual (default)

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (BMA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

Data Types: single | double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer [0,1]

End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days, specified as scalar nonnegative integer [0,
1] or a using a N-by-1 vector of values. This rule applies only when Maturity is an end-of-month date
for a month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a payment date is always the same numerical day of the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a payment date is always the last actual day of the month.

Data Types: logical

Output Arguments

TFactors — Time factors
vector

Time factors, appropriate to compounded rate quotes between Settle and Maturity dates,
returned as a vector.
