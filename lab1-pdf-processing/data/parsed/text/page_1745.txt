Equality Constraint

An equality constraint requires certain conditions to be met exactly, rather than allowing for a range
of values.

Tips

•
You can also use dot notation to add the linear equality constraints for portfolio weights.

obj = obj.addEquality(AEquality, bEquality)

•
You can also remove linear equality constraints from a portfolio object using dot notation.

obj = obj.setEquality([ ], [ ])
