Obtain Inequality Constraints for a PortfolioMAD Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets
constitute at most 50% of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, set the linear inequality
constraints and then obtain values for AInequality and bInequality.

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setInequality(p, A, b);
[AInequality, bInequality] = getInequality(p)

AInequality = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

bInequality = 
0.5000
