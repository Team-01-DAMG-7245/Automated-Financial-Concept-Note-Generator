The default portfolio optimization problem (see “Default Portfolio Problem” on page 6-15) has lB = 0
with uB set implicitly through a budget constraint.

'Conditional' Bound Constraints

'Conditional' Bound constraints, also called semicontinuous constraints, are mixed-integer linear
constraints that confine portfolio weights to fall either above or below specific bounds if the asset is
selected; otherwise, the value of the asset is zero. Use setBounds to specify bound constraints with
a 'Conditional' BoundType. To mathematically formulate this type of constraints, a binary
variable vi is needed. vi = 0 indicates that asset i is not selected and vi indicates that the asset was
selected. Thus

livi ≤xi ≤uivi

where

x is the portfolio (n vector).

l is the conditional lower-bound constraint (n vector).

u is the conditional upper-bound constraint (n vector).

n is the number of assets in the universe.

PortfolioMAD object properties to specify the bound constraint are:

•
LowerBound for lB
•
UpperBound for uB
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore this constraint.

Budget Constraints

Budget constraints are specialized linear constraints that confine the sum of portfolio weights to fall
either above or below specific bounds. The constraints take the form

lS ≤1Tx ≤uS

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

1 is the vector of ones (n vector).

lS is the lower-bound budget constraint (scalar).

uS is the upper-bound budget constraint (scalar).

n is the number of assets in the universe.

PortfolioMAD object properties to specify budget constraints are:
