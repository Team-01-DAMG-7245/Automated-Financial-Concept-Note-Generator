Assess GPD Fit

Examine the GPD fit in more detail.

The CDF of a GPD is parameterized as

F(y) = 1 −(1 + ζy/β)−1/ζ, y > = 0, β > 0, ζ > −0 . 5

for exceedances (y), tail index parameter (ζ), and scale parameter (β).

To visually assess the GPD fit, plot the empirical CDF of the upper tail exceedances of the residuals
along with the CDF fitted by the GPD. Although only 10% of the standardized residuals are used, the
fitted distribution closely follows the exceedance data, so the GPD model is an appropriate choice.

figure
[P,Q] = boundary(tails{index});  % Cumulative probabilities & quantiles at boundaries
y     = sort(residuals(residuals(:,index) > Q(2), index) - Q(2)); % Sort exceedances
plot(y, (cdf(tails{index}, y + Q(2)) - P(2))/P(1))
[F,x] = ecdf(y);                 % Empirical CDF
hold on
