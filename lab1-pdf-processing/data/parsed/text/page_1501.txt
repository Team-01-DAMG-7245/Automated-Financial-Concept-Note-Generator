If you specify JumpVol as a deterministic function of time, you call JumpVol with a real-valued scalar
time t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify JumpVol as a function of time and state, JumpVol must return a scalar when you call it
with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
A 2-by-1 bivariate state vector Xt

Data Types: double | function_handle

Output Arguments

Bates — Bates model
Bates object

Bates model, returned as a Bates object.

Properties

StartTime — Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables
0 (default) | scalar

Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables, specified as a scalar.

Data Types: double

StartState — Initial values of state variables
1 (default) | scalar | column vector | matrix

Initial values of state variables, specified as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

If StartState is a scalar, bates applies the same initial value to all state variables on all trials.

If StartState is a bivariate column vector, bates applies a unique initial value to each state
variable on all trials.

If StartState is a matrix, bates applies a unique initial value to each state variable on each trial.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
2-by-2 identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) | positive semidefinite
matrix | deterministic function

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as a scalar, a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite matrix, or as a deterministic
function Ct that accepts the current time t and returns an 2-by-2 positive semidefinite correlation
matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use nearcorr to create a
positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

A Correlation matrix represents a static condition.

If you specify Correlation as a deterministic function of time, Correlation allows you to specify a
dynamic correlation structure.
