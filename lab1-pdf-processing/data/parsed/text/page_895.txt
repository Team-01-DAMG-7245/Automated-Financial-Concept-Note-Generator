Working with Other Portfolio Objects

This example shows how to examine portfolio optimization problems according to different
combinations of return and risk proxies.The PortfolioMAD object is for MAD portfolio optimization.
The Portfolio object is for mean-variance portfolio optimization. Sometimes, you might want to
examine portfolio optimization problems according to different combinations of return and risk
proxies. A common example is that you want to do a MAD portfolio optimization and then want to
work primarily with moments of portfolio returns. Suppose that you set up a MAD portfolio
optimization problem with:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

pwgt0 = [ 0.3; 0.3; 0.2; 0.1 ];

rng('default')
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setAssetList(p, 'Bonds','Large-Cap Equities','Small-Cap Equities','Emerging Equities');
p = setInitPort(p, pwgt0);
p = simulateNormalScenariosByMoments(p, m, C, 20000);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

To work with the same problem in a mean-variance framework, you can use the scenarios from the
PortfolioMAD object to set up a Portfolio object so that p contains a MAD optimization problem
and q contains a mean-variance optimization problem based on the same data.

q = Portfolio('AssetList', p.AssetList);
q = estimateAssetMoments(q, p.getScenarios);
q = setDefaultConstraints(q);

pwgt = estimateFrontier(p);
qwgt = estimateFrontier(q);

Since each object has a different risk proxy, it is not possible to compare results side by side. To
obtain means and standard deviations of portfolio returns, you can use the functions associated with
each object to obtain:

pret = estimatePortReturn(p, pwgt);
pstd = estimatePortStd(p, pwgt);
qret = estimatePortReturn(q, qwgt);
qstd = estimatePortStd(q, qwgt);

[pret, qret]
