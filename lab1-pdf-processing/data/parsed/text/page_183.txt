x is the portfolio (n vector)

1 is the vector of ones (n vector).

x0 is the Initial portfolio (n vector).

τB is the upper bound for turnover constraint on purchases (scalar).

τS is the upper bound for turnover constraint on sales (scalar).

To specify one-way turnover constraints, use the following properties in the Portfolio,
PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object:

•
BuyTurnover for τB
•
SellTurnover for τS
•
InitPort for x0

The default is to ignore this constraint.

Note The average turnover constraint (see “Working with Average Turnover Constraints Using
Portfolio Object” on page 4-85) with τ is not a combination of the one-way turnover constraints with
τ = τB = τS.

Tracking Error Constraints

Tracking error constraint, within a portfolio optimization framework, is an additional constraint to
specify the set of feasible portfolios known as a portfolio set. Use setTrackingError to set tracking
error constraints. The tracking-error constraint has the form

(x −xT)TC(x −xT) ≤τT2

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

xT is the tracking portfolio against which risk is to be measured (n vector).

C is the covariance of asset returns.

τT is the upper bound for tracking error (scalar).

n is the number of assets in the universe.

Portfolio object properties to specify the average turnover constraint are:

•
TrackingPort for xT
•
TrackingError for τT

The default is to ignore this constraint.

Note The tracking error constraints can be used with any of the other supported constraints in the
Portfolio object without restrictions. However, since the portfolio set necessarily and sufficiently
