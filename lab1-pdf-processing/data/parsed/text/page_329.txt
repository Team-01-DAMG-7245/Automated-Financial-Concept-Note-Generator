Portfolio Optimization Examples Using Financial Toolbox

Follow a sequence of examples that highlight features of the Portfolio object. Specifically, the
examples use the Portfolio object to show how to set up mean-variance portfolio optimization
problems that focus on the two-fund theorem, the impact of transaction costs and turnover
constraints, how to obtain portfolios that maximize the Sharpe ratio, and how to set up two popular
hedge-fund strategies â€” dollar-neutral and 130-30 portfolios.

Set up the Data

Every example works with moments for monthly total returns of a universe of 30 "blue-chip" stocks.
Although derived from real data, these data are for illustrative purposes and are not meant to be
representative of specific assets or of market performance. The data are contained in the file
BlueChipStockMoments.mat with a list of asset identifiers in the variable AssetList, a mean and
covariance of asset returns in the variables AssetMean and AssetCovar, and the mean and variance
of cash and market returns in the variables CashMean, CashVar, MarketMean, and MarketVar.
Since most of the analysis requires the use of the standard deviation of asset returns as the proxy for
risk, cash, and market variances are converted into standard deviations.

load BlueChipStockMoments

mret = MarketMean;
mrsk = sqrt(MarketVar);
cret = CashMean;
crsk = sqrt(CashVar);

Create a Portfolio Object

First create a "standard" Portfolio object with Portfolio to incorporate the list of assets, the
risk-free rate, and the moments of asset returns into the object.

p = Portfolio('AssetList',AssetList,'RiskFreeRate',CashMean);
p = setAssetMoments(p,AssetMean,AssetCovar);

To provide a basis for comparison, set up an equal-weight portfolio and make it the initial portfolio in
the Portfolio object. Keep in mind that the hedged portfolios to be constructed later will require a
different initial portfolio. Once the initial portfolio is created, the estimatePortMoments function
estimates the mean and standard deviation of equal-weight portfolio returns.

p = setInitPort(p,1/p.NumAssets);
[ersk,eret] = estimatePortMoments(p,p.InitPort);

A specialized "helper" function portfolioexamples_plot makes it possible to plot all results to be
developed here. The first plot shows the distribution of individual assets according to their means and
standard deviations of returns. In addition, the equal-weight, market, and cash portfolios are plotted
on the same plot. Note that the portfolioexamples_plot function converts monthly total returns
into annualized total returns.

clf;
portfolioexamples_plot('Asset Risks and Returns', ...
    {'scatter', mrsk, mret, {'Market'}}, ...
    {'scatter', crsk, cret, {'Cash'}}, ...
    {'scatter', ersk, eret, {'Equal'}}, ...
    {'scatter', sqrt(diag(p.AssetCovar)), p.AssetMean, p.AssetList, '.r'});
