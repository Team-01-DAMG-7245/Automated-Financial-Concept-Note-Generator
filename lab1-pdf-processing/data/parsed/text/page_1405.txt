Algorithms

When you specify the input arguments A and B as MATLAB arrays, they are associated with a linear
drift parametric form. By contrast, when you specify either A or B as a function, you can customize
virtually any drift-rate specification.

Accessing the output drift-rate parameters A and B with no inputs simply returns the original input
specification. Thus, when you invoke drift-rate parameters with no inputs, they behave like simple
properties and allow you to test the data type (double vs. function, or equivalently, static vs. dynamic)
of the original input specification. This is useful for validating and designing methods.

When you invoke drift-rate parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the impression
of dynamic behavior. The parameters A and B accept the observation time t and a state vector Xt, and
return an array of appropriate dimension. Specifically, parameters A and B evaluate the
corresponding drift-rate component. Even if you originally specified an input as an array, drift
treats it as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing that all parameters are
accessible by the same interface.
