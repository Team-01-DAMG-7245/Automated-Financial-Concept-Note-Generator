cpndatenq

Next quasi-coupon date for fixed-income security

Syntax

NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq(Settle,Maturity)
NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate)

Description

NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq(Settle,Maturity) determines the next quasi coupon
date for a portfolio of NUMBONDS fixed income securities whether or not the first or last coupon is
normal, short, or long. For zero coupon bonds, cpndatenq returns quasi coupon dates as if the bond
had a semiannual coupon structure. Successive quasi coupon dates determine the length of the
standard coupon period for the fixed income security of interest and do not necessarily coincide with
actual coupon payment dates.

Required input arguments must be number of bonds, NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS, conforming
vectors or scalars.

NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate) determines the next quasi coupon date for a portfolio of
NUMBONDS fixed income securities whether or not the first or last coupon is normal, short, or long
using optional input arguments.

Optional input arguments must be either NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS conforming vectors,
scalars, or empty matrices.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then NextQuasiCouponDate is returned as a serial date
number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then NextQuasiCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.

Examples

Determine the Next Quasi Coupon Date for a Portfolio of Fixed-Income Securities

Given a pair of bonds with the following characteristics:

Settle = [datetime(1997,5,30), datetime(1997,12,10)]; 
Maturity = [datetime(2002,11,30), datetime(2004,6,10)];

Compute NextCouponDate for this pair of bonds.

NextCouponDate = cpndaten(Settle, Maturity)
