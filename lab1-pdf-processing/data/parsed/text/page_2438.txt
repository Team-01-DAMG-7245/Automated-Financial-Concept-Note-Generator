holidays and then associated to the NYSE calendar) is used.

Input Arguments

Date — Date being checked
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Date being checked, specified as a scalar or a vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. Date can contain multiple dates, but they must all be in the same format. Dates
are assumed to be whole date numbers or date stamps with no fractional or time values.

To support existing code, isbusday also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

non-trading day vector is determined by the routine holidays (default) | datetime array | string
array | date character vector

character vectors.

All dates in Holiday must be the same format: either datetimes, strings, date character vectors, or
serial date numbers. The holidays function supplies the default vector.

To support existing code, isbusday also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime
