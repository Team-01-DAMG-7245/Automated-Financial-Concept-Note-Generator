Although the results for complete-data stocks are the same as in “Estimation of Some Technology
Stock Betas” on page 9-27, the beta estimates for AMZN and GOOG (the two stocks with missing
values) are different from the estimates derived for each stock separately. Since AMZN has few
missing values, the differences in the estimates are small. With GOOG, however, the differences are
more pronounced.

The t-statistic for the beta estimate of GOOG is now significant at the 99.5% level of significance.
However, the t-statistics for beta estimates are based on standard errors from the sample Hessian
which, in contrast to the Fisher information matrix, accounts for the increased uncertainty in an
estimate due to missing values. If the t-statistic is obtained from the more optimistic Fisher
information matrix, the t-statistic for GOOG is 8.25. Thus, despite the increase in uncertainty due to
missing data, GOOG nonetheless has a statistically significant estimate for beta.

Finally, note that the beta estimate for GOOG is 0.62 — a value that may require some explanation.
Although the market has been volatile over this period with sideways price movements, GOOG has
steadily appreciated in value. So, it is less tightly correlated with the market, implying that it is less
volatile than the market (beta < 1).
