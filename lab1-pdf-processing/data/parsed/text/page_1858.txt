Input Arguments

ZeroData — Zero curve
matrix | table

Zero Curve, specified as a numRates-by-2 matrix or a numRates-by-2 table.

If ZeroData is represented as a numRates-by-2 matrix, the first column is a MATLAB serial date
number and the second column is the accompanying zero rates.

If ZeroData is a table, the first column can be a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors. The second column must be numeric data corresponding to the zero rates.

Data Types: double | datetime | char | string | table

CouponRate — Annual percentage rate used to determine coupons payable on a bond
decimal

Annual percentage rate used to determine the coupons payable on a bond, specified as decimal value
using a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date for all bonds and zero curve
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Settlement date for all bonds and zero curve, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date character
vector. Settle must be the same settlement date for all the bonds and the zero curve.

To support existing code, bndkrdur also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date for bonds
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date for bonds, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array,
string array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, bndkrdur also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime
