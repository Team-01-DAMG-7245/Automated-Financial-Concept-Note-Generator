datemnth

Date of day in future or past month

Syntax

TargetDate = datemnth(StartDate,NumberMonths)
TargetDate = datemnth( ___ ,DayFlag,Basis,EndMonthRule)

Description

TargetDate = datemnth(StartDate,NumberMonths) determines a date in a future or past
month based on movement either forward or backward in time by a given number of months.

Any input can contain multiple values, but if so, all other inputs must contain the same number of
values or a single value that applies to all. For example, if StartDate is an n-row datetime, then
NumberMonths must be an N-by-1 vector of integers or a single integer. TargetDate is then an N-
by-1 vector of datetimes.

If StartDate is a string or date character vector, TargetDate is returned as a serial date number.
Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If StartDate is a datetime array, then TargetDate is returned as a datetime array.

TargetDate = datemnth( ___ ,DayFlag,Basis,EndMonthRule) determines a date in a future
or past month based on movement either forward or backward in time by a given number of months,
using optional input arguments for DayFlag,Basis, and EndMonthRule.

Examples

Determine the Dates of Days in a Future Month

Determine the TargetDate in a future month using a datetime for StartDate.

StartDate = datetime(1997,6,3);
NumberMonths = 6;
DayFlag = 0;
Basis = 0;
EndMonthRule = 1;
 
TargetDate = datemnth(StartDate, NumberMonths, DayFlag,Basis, EndMonthRule)

TargetDate = datetime
   03-Dec-1997

Determine the TargetDate in a future month using a vector for NumberMonths.

NumberMonths = [1; 3; 5; 7; 9];
TargetDate = datemnth(datetime(2001,1,31), NumberMonths)
