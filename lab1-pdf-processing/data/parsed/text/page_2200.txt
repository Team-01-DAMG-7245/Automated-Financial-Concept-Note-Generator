ecmnmle

Mean and covariance of incomplete multivariate normal data

Syntax

ecmnmle(Data)
[Mean,Covariance] = ecmnmle(Data)
[Mean,Covariance] = ecmnmle( ___ ,InitMethod,MaxIterations,Tolerance,Mean0,
Covar0)

Description

ecmnmle(Data) with no output arguments, this mode displays the convergence of the ECM
algorithm in a plot by estimating objective function values for each iteration of the ECM algorithm
until termination.

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmnmle(Data) estimates the mean and covariance of a data set (Data).
If the data set has missing values, this routine implements the ECM algorithm of Meng and Rubin [2]
with enhancements by Sexton and Swensen [3]. ECM stands for a conditional maximization form of
the EM algorithm of Dempster, Laird, and Rubin [4].

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmnmle( ___ ,InitMethod,MaxIterations,Tolerance,Mean0,
Covar0) adds an optional arguments for InitMethod, MaxIterations, Tolerance,Mean0, and
Covar0.

Examples

Compute Mean and Covariance of Incomplete Multivariate Normal Data

This example shows how to compute the mean and covariance of incomplete multivariate normal data
for five years of daily total return data for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and six
software companies

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.
