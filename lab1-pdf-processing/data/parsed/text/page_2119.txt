days252bus

Number of business days between dates

Syntax

NumberDays = days252bus(StartDate,EndDate)
NumberDays = days252bus( ___ HolidayVector)

Description

NumberDays = days252bus(StartDate,EndDate) computes the number of business days (that
is, non-holiday or non-weekend) between the two input dates.

NumberDays = days252bus( ___ HolidayVector) adds an optional argument for
HolidayVector. If a holiday vector is not optionally specified, then the holidays.m file is used to
determine the holidays.
