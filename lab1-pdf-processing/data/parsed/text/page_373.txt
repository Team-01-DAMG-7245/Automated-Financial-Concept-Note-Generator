and used in the Portfolio object. In this example, the expected returns and covariances of the
assets in the portfolio are set to their historical values.

p = Portfolio('AssetList',assetNames);

Set up default portfolio constraints (all weights sum to 1, no shorting, and 100% investment in risky
assets).

p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

Add asset returns and covariance to the Portfolio object.

activReturn = assetReturn - benchReturn;
pAct = estimateAssetMoments(p,activReturn,'missingdata',false)

Compute the Efficient Frontier Using the Portfolio Object

Compute the mean-variance efficient frontier of 20 optimal portfolios. Visualize the frontier over the
risk-return characteristics of the individual assets. Furthermore, calculate and visualize the
information ratio for each portfolio along the frontier.
