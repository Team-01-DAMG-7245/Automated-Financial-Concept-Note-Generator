simByTransition applies processing functions at the end of each observation period. The
processing functions accept the current observation time t and the current state vector Xt, and return
a state vector that may adjust the input state.

If you specify more than one processing function, simByTransition invokes the functions in the
order in which they appear in the cell array.

Output Arguments

Paths — Simulated paths of correlated state variables
array

Simulated paths of correlated state variables, returned as an (NPeriods + 1)-by-NVars-by-
NTrials three-dimensional time series array.

For a given trial, each row of Paths is the transpose of the state vector Xt at time t. When the input
flag StorePaths = False, simByTransition returns Paths as an empty matrix.

Times — Observation times associated with simulated paths
column vector

Observation times associated with the simulated paths, returned as an (NPeriods + 1)-by-1
column vector. Each element of Times is associated with the corresponding row of Paths.

Transition Density

Transition density describes the probability distribution of a state variable transitioning from one
state to another over a given time interval.

Transition Density Simulation

The SDE has no solution such that r(t) = f(r(0),⋯).

In other words, the equation is not explicitly solvable. However, the transition density for the process
is known.

The exact simulation for the distribution of r(t_1 ),⋯,r(t_n) is that of the process at times t_1,⋯,t_n for
the same value of r(0). The transition density for this process is known and is expressed as

r(t) = σ2(1 −e−α(t −u)

4α
xd
2
4αe−α(t −u)

σ2(1 −e−α(t −u))
r(u) , t > u
