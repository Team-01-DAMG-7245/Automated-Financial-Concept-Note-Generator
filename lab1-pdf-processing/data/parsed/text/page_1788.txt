blkprice

Black model for pricing futures options

Syntax

[Call,Put] = blkprice(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)

Description

[Call,Put] = blkprice(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) computes European put
and call futures option prices using Black's model.

Note Any input argument can be a scalar, vector, or matrix. If a scalar, then that value is used to
price all options. If more than one input is a vector or matrix, then the dimensions of those non-scalar
inputs must be the same.

Ensure that Rate, Time, and Volatility are expressed in consistent units of time.

Examples

Compute European Put and Call Futures Option Prices Using Black's Model

This example shows how to price European futures options with exercise prices of $20 that expire in
four months. Assume that the current underlying futures price is also $20 with a volatility of 25% per
annum. The risk-free rate is 9% per annum.

[Call, Put] = blkprice(20, 20, 0.09, 4/12, 0.25)

Call = 
1.1166

Put = 
1.1166

Input Arguments

Price — Current price of underlying asset
numeric

Current price of the underlying asset (that is, a futures contract), specified as a numeric value.

Data Types: double

Strike — Exercise price of the futures option
