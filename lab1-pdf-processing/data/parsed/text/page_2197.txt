ecmninit

Initial mean and covariance

Syntax

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmninit(Data,InitMethod)
[Mean,Covariance] = ecmninit( ___ ,InitMethod)

Description

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmninit(Data,InitMethod) creates initial mean and covariance
estimates for the function ecmnmle.

[Mean,Covariance] = ecmninit( ___ ,InitMethod) adds an optional argument for
InitMethod.

Examples

Compute Initial Mean and Covariance

This example shows how to compute the initial mean and covariance for five years of daily total
return data for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and six software companies

load ecmtechdemo.mat

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

A naïve approach to the estimation of the mean and covariance for these 12 assets is to eliminate all
days that have missing values for any of the 12 assets. Use the ecminit function with the
'nanskip' option to do this.

[NaNMean, NaNCovar] = ecmninit(Data,'nanskip')

NaNMean = 12×1
