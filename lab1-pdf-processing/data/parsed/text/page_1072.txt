Multivariate Normal Regression With Missing Data

Estimate parameters using ecmmvnrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = ecmmvnrmle(Data, Design);

Estimate standard errors using ecmmvnrstd:

StdParameters = ecmmvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Least-Squares Regression

Least-squares regression, or LSR, sometimes called ordinary least-squares or multiple linear
regression, is the simplest linear regression model. It also enjoys the property that, independent of
the underlying distribution, it is a best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE).

Given m = NumSamples observations, the typical least-squares regression model seeks to minimize
the objective function

which, within the maximum likelihood framework of the multivariate normal regression routine
mvnrmle, is equivalent to a single-iteration estimation of just the parameters to obtain Parameters
with the initial covariance matrix Covariance held fixed as the identity matrix. In the case of
missing data, however, the internal algorithm to handle missing data requires a separate routine
ecmlsrmle to do least-squares instead of multivariate normal regression.

Least-Squares Regression Without Missing Data

Estimate parameters using mvnrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = mvnrmle(Data, Design, 1);

Estimate standard errors using mvnrstd:

StdParameters = mvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Least-Squares Regression With Missing Data

Estimate parameters using ecmlsrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = ecmlsrmle(Data, Design);

Estimate standard errors using ecmmvnrstd:

StdParameters = ecmmvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Covariance-Weighted Least Squares

Given m = NUMSAMPLES observations, the typical covariance-weighted least squares, or CWLS,
regression model seeks to minimize the objective function
