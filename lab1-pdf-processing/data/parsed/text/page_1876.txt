Price — Clean price for every $100 notional amount of bonds whose spreads are computed
numeric

Clean price for every $100 notional amount of bonds whose spreads are computed, specified as
numeric value using a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.

The clean price is the price of a bond not including accrued interest payments. The clean price is
typically the quoted price on financial news sites. This price does not include any interest accrued
between the scheduled coupon payments for the bond.

Data Types: double

Coupon — Annual coupon rate of bonds whose spreads are computed
decimal

Annual coupon rate of bonds whose spreads are computed, specified as decimal value using a scalar
or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date of bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date of the bond, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using
a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors. The Settle date must be before the
Maturity date.

To support existing code, bndspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date of bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date of the bond, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, bndspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
