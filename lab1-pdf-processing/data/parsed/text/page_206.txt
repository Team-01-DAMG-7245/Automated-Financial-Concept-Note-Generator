Portfolio object functions that work with either transaction costs or turnover constraints also depend
on the InitPort property. So, the set functions for transaction costs or turnover constraints permit
the assignment of a value for the InitPort property as part of their implementation. For details, see
“Working with Average Turnover Constraints Using Portfolio Object” on page 4-85, “Working with
One-Way Turnover Constraints Using Portfolio Object” on page 4-88, and “Working with Transaction
Costs” on page 4-54 for details. If either transaction costs or turnover constraints are used, then the
InitPort property must have a nonempty value. Absent a specific value assigned through the
Portfolio object or various set functions, the Portfolio object sets InitPort to 0 and warns if
BuyCost, SellCost, or Turnover properties are set. The following example illustrates what
happens if an average turnover constraint is specified with an initial portfolio:

p = Portfolio('Turnover', 0.3, 'InitPort', [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ]);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.3000
 0.2000
 0.2000
      0

In contrast, this example shows what happens if an average turnover constraint is specified without
an initial portfolio:

p = Portfolio('Turnover', 0.3);
disp(p.InitPort)

Warning: InitPort and NumAssets are empty and either transaction costs or turnover constraints specified.
Will set NumAssets = 1 and InitPort = 0.
