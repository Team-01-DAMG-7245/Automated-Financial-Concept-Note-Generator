The portfolio allocation of the minimum variance portfolio sets all assets with the smallest risk to
their maximum (30%). On the other hand, the risk parity allocation sets only the first two assets to
30% and the last two are more balanced. This result is a simple example of how the risk parity
allocation helps to diversify a portfolio.
