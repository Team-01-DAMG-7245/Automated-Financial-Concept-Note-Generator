•
'direct' — Construct one optimization problem to maximize the portfolio return with target risk
as the nonlinear constraint, and solve it directly using fmincon, instead of iteratively exploring
the efficient frontier. For an example of using the 'direct' option, see “Obtain Portfolios with
Targeted Portfolio Risks for a Portfolio Object Using the Direct Method and Solver Options” on
page 15-974 and “Obtain Portfolios with Targeted Portfolio Risks for a PortfolioMAD Object Using
the Direct Method and Solver Options” on page 15-976.

•
'iterative' — One-dimensional optimization using fminbnd to find the portfolio return
between min and max return on the frontier that minimizes the difference between the actual risk
and target risk. Then the portfolio weights are obtained by solving a frontier by return problem.
Consequently, the 'iterative' method is slower than the 'direct'.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

pwgt — Optimal portfolios on efficient frontier with specified target risks
matrix

Optimal portfolios on the efficient frontier with specified target returns from TargetRisk, returned
as a NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix. pwgt is returned for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

pbuy — Purchases relative to initial portfolio for optimal portfolios on efficient frontier
matrix

Purchases relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios on the efficient frontier, returned as
NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix.

Note If no initial portfolio is specified in obj.InitPort, that value is assumed to be 0 such that
pbuy = max(0,pwgt) and psell = max(0,-pwgt).

pbuy is returned for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

psell — Sales relative to initial portfolio for optimal portfolios on efficient frontier
matrix

Sales relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios on the efficient frontier, returned as a
NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix.

Note If no initial portfolio is specified in obj.InitPort, that value is assumed to be 0 such that
pbuy = max(0,pwgt) and psell = max(0,-pwgt).

psell is returned for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

Tips

You can also use dot notation to estimate optimal portfolios with targeted portfolio risks.

[pwgt,pbuy,psell] = obj.estimateFrontierByRisk(TargetRisk);
