Sensitivity of Bond Prices to Interest Rates

This example demonstrates an analysis of duration and convexity for a bond portfolio using SIA-
compliant bond functions.

Macaulay and modified duration measure the sensitivity of a bond's price to changes in the level of
interest rates. Convexity measures the change in duration for small shifts in the yield curve, and thus
measures the second-order price sensitivity of a bond. Both measures can gauge the vulnerability of a
bond portfolio's value to changes in the level of interest rates.

Alternatively, analysts can use duration and convexity to construct a bond portfolio that is partly
hedged against small shifts in the term structure. If you combine bonds in a portfolio whose duration
is zero, the portfolio is insulated, to some extent, against interest rate changes. If the portfolio
convexity is also zero, this insulation is even better. However, since hedging costs money or reduces
expected return, you must know how much protection results from hedging duration alone compared
to hedging both duration and convexity.

The code in this example demonstrates a way to analyze the relative importance of duration and
convexity for a bond portfolio using some of the SIA-compliant bond functions in Financial Toolboxâ„¢
software. Using duration, this example constructs a first-order approximation of the change in
portfolio price to a level shift in interest rates. Then, using convexity, this example calculates a
second-order approximation. Finally, ths example compares the two approximations with the true
price change resulting from a change in the yield curve.

Define Bonds

Define three bonds using values for the settlement date, maturity date, face value, and coupon rate.
For simplicity, accept default values for the coupon payment periodicity (semiannual), end-of-month
payment rule (rule in effect), and day-count basis (actual/actual). Also, synchronize the coupon
payment structure to the maturity date (no odd first or last coupon dates). Any inputs for which
defaults are accepted are set to empty matrices ([]) as placeholders where appropriate.

Settle     = '19-Aug-1999';
Maturity   = ['17-Jun-2010'; '09-Jun-2015'; '14-May-2025'];
Face       = [100; 100; 1000];
CouponRate = [0.07; 0.06; 0.045];

Specify the yield curve information.

Yields = [0.05; 0.06; 0.065];

Calculate Bond Price, Modified Duration, and Convexity

For each bond, calculate the price using bndprice, modified duration in years using bnddury, and
convexity in years using bndconvy. The true price is quoted (clean) price plus accrued interest.

[CleanPrice, AccruedInterest] = bndprice(Yields, CouponRate, ...
Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, [], [], [], [], [], Face);

Durations = bnddury(Yields, CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, ...
[], [], [], [], [], Face);

Convexities = bndconvy(Yields, CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, ...
[], [], [], [], [], Face);
