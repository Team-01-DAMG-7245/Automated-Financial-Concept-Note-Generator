•
Rate: The diffusion-rate function, G(t,Xt).

•
Alpha: The state vector exponent, which determines the format of D(t,Xt) of G(t,Xt).

•
Sigma: The volatility rate, V(t,Xt), of G(t,Xt).

Alpha and Sigma enable you to query the original inputs. (The combined effect of the individual
Alpha and Sigma parameters is fully encapsulated by the function stored in Rate.) The Rate
functions are the calculation engines for the drift and diffusion objects, and are the only
parameters required for simulation.

Note You can express drift and diffusion classes in the most general form to emphasize the
functional (t, Xt) interface. However, you can specify the components A and B as functions that adhere
to the common (t, Xt) interface, or as MATLAB arrays of appropriate dimension.

Example: G = diffusion(1, 0.3) % Diffusion rate function G(t,X)

Examples

Create a sdeld Object

The sdeld class derives from the sdeddo class. These objects allow you to simulate correlated paths
of NVARS state variables expressed in linear drift-rate form:

dXt = (A(t) + B(t)Xt)dt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt.

obj = sdeld(0, 0.1, 1, 0.3) % (A, B, Alpha, Sigma)
