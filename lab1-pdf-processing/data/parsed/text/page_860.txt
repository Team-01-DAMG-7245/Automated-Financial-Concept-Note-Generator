Sometimes, you may want to validate either your inputs to, or outputs from, a portfolio optimization
problem. Although most error checking that occurs during the problem setup phase catches most
difficulties with a portfolio optimization problem, the processes to validate MAD portfolio sets and
portfolios are time consuming and are best done offline. So, the portfolio optimization tools have
specialized functions to validate MAD portfolio sets and portfolios. For information on the workflow
when using PortfolioMAD objects, see “PortfolioMAD Object Workflow” on page 6-16.

Validating a MAD Portfolio Set

Since it is necessary and sufficient that your MAD portfolio set must be a nonempty, closed, and
bounded set to have a valid portfolio optimization problem, the estimateBounds function lets you
examine your portfolio set to determine if it is nonempty and, if nonempty, whether it is bounded.
Suppose that you have the following MAD portfolio set which is an empty set because the initial
portfolio at 0 is too far from a portfolio that satisfies the budget and turnover constraint:

p = PortfolioMAD('NumAssets', 3, 'Budget', 1);
p = setTurnover(p, 0.3, 0);

If a MAD portfolio set is empty, estimateBounds returns NaN bounds and sets the isbounded flag
to []:

[lb, ub, isbounded] = estimateBounds(p)

lb =

NaN
   NaN
   NaN

ub =

NaN
   NaN
   NaN

isbounded =

[]

Suppose that you create an unbounded MAD portfolio set as follows:

p = PortfolioMAD('AInequality', [1 -1; 1 1 ], 'bInequality', 0);
[lb, ub, isbounded] = estimateBounds(p)

lb =

-Inf
  -Inf
