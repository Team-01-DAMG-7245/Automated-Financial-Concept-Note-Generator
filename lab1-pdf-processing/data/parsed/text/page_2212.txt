Mean — Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for mean of Data
vector

Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the mean of the Data using the ECM algorithm,
specified as a NUMSERIES-by-1 column vector.

Covariance — Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for covariance of Data
matrix

Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the covariance of the Data using the ECM algorithm,
specified as a NUMSERIES-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

Method — Method of estimation for standard error calculations
'hessian' (default) | character vector

(Optional) Method of estimation for standard error calculations, specified as a character vector. The
estimation methods are:

•
'hessian' — The Hessian of the observed negative log-likelihood function. This method is
recommended since the resultant standard errors incorporate the increase uncertainties due to
missing data. In particular, standard errors calculated with the Hessian are generally larger than
standard errors calculated with the Fisher information matrix.

•
'fisher' — The Fisher information matrix.

Data Types: char
