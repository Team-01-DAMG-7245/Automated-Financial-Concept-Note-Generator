blsvega

Black-Scholes sensitivity to underlying price volatility

Syntax

Vega = blsvega(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
Vega = blsvega( ___ ,Yield)

Description

Vega = blsvega(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns the rate of change of the
option value with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset. blsvega uses normpdf, the normal
probability density function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and vega values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blsvega can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

Vega = blsvega( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Compute Black-Scholes Sensitivity to Underlying Price Volatility (Vega)

This example shows how to compute vega, the rate of change of the option value with respect to the
volatility of the underlying asset.

Vega = blsvega(50, 50, 0.12, 0.25, 0.3, 0)

Vega = 
9.6035
