If pc(t − 1) = −4 and pc(t) = 2, the real part of log(pc(t)) − log(pc(t − 1)) is negative (line slopes
down), corresponding to a decrease in absolute price. The imaginary part is 0 – π = −π,
corresponding to a change of sign from negative to positive. If the direction of the price movement is
reversed, so that pc(t − 1) = 2 and pc(t) = −4, the positive difference in the real part corresponds to
an increase in absolute price, and the positive difference in the imaginary part corresponds to a
change of sign from positive to negative.

If you convert the continuous returns rc(t) = log(pc(t)/pc(t − 1) ) to simple returns rs = (ps(t)/ps(t − 1)
− 1) by the following computation, the result is the same simple returns series as before.

rs = exp(rc) - 1

rs =

-0.6667 + 0.0000i
  -3.0000 + 0.0000i
  -0.5000 + 0.0000i
  -2.0000 - 0.0000i

You can complete the round trip, which results in the expected price series, by the computation

pc = ret2tick(rc,Method="continuous",StartPrice=3)

pc =

3.0000 + 0.0000i
   1.0000 + 0.0000i
  -2.0000 + 0.0000i
  -1.0000 + 0.0000i
   1.0000 + 0.0000i
