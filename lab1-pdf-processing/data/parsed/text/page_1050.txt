Treat Missing Data in a Credit Scorecard Workflow Using
MATLAB fillmissing

This example shows a workflow to gather missing data, manually treat the training data, develop a
new creditscorecard, and treat new data before scoring using the MATLAB® fillmissing.

The advantage of this method is that you can use all the options available in fillmissing to fill
missing data, as well as other MATLAB functionality such as standardizeMissing and features for
the treatment of outliers. In this approach, note that you must ensure that the treatment of the
training data and the treatment of any new data set that requires scoring must be the same.

Alternatively, after you create a creditscorecard object, you can use the fillmissing function
for the creditscorecard object to fill missing values. For additional information on alternative
approaches for "treating" missing data, see “Credit Scorecard Modeling with Missing Values” on page
8-57.

The dataMissing table in the CreditCardData.mat file has two predictors with missing values —
CustAge and ResStatus.

First, analyze the missing data information using the untreated training data.

Create a creditscorecard object using the CreditCardData.mat file to load the dataMissing
that contains missing values. Set the 'BinMissingData' argument for creditscorecard to true
to explicitly report information on missing values. Then apply automatic binning using autobinning.

sc = creditscorecard(dataMissing,'IDVar','CustID','BinMissingData',true);
sc = autobinning(sc);

The bin information and bin plots for predictors that have missing data both show a <missing> bin
at the end. The two predictors with missing values in this data set are CustAge and ResStatus.

bi = bininfo(sc,'CustAge');
disp(bi)
