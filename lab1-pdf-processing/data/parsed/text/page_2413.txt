More About

Inequality Constraint

An inequality constraint specifies a range of acceptable values rather than requiring an exact value.

Use inequality constraints to impose limits on certain parameters of the portfolio to ensure that the
portfolio adheres to specific guidelines or preferences set by the investor or portfolio manager.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to obtain the inequality constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

[AInequality, bInequality] = obj.getInequality;
