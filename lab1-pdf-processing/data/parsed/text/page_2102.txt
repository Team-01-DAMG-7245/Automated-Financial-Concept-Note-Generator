Difference Between yearfrac and date2time

The difference between yearfrac and date2time is that date2time counts full periods as a whole
integer, even if the number of actual days in the periods are different. yearfrac does not count full
periods.

For example,

yearfrac('1/1/2000', '1/1/2001', 9)

ans =

1.0167

yearfrac for Basis 9 (ACT/360 ICMA) calculates 366/360 = 1.0167. So, even if the dates have the
same month and date, with a difference of 1 in the year, the returned value may not be exactly 1. On
the other hand, date2time calculates one full year period:

date2time('1/1/2000', '1/1/2001', 1, 9)

ans =

1

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although date2time supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
