Return series, specified the number of observations (NUMOBS) by number of assets (NASSETS) matrix
of equally spaced incremental return observations. The first row is the oldest observation, and the
last row is the most recent.

Data Types: double

DecayFactor — Controls how much less each observation is weighted than its successor
1 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Controls how much less each observation is weighted than its successor, specified as a
numeric value. The kth observation back in time has weight DecayFactork. DecayFactor must lie
in the range: 0 < DecayFactor <= 1.

The default value of 1 is the equally weighted linear moving average model (BIS).

Data Types: double

WindowLength — Number of recent observations in computation
NUMOBS (default) | numeric

(Optional) Number of recent observations in the computation, specified as a numeric value.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

ExpReturn — Estimated expected returns
vector

Estimated expected returns, returned as a 1-by-NASSETS vector.

ExpCovariance — Estimated covariance matrix
matrix

Estimated covariance matrix, returned as a NASSETS-by-NASSETS matrix.

The standard deviations of the asset return processes are defined as

STDVec = sqrt(diag(ExpCovariance))

The correlation matrix is

CorrMat = ExpCovariance./( STDVec*STDVec' )

NumEffObs — Number of effective observations
numeric

NumEffObs is the number of effective observations where

NumEf fObs = 1 −DecayFactorWindowLength

1 −DecayFactor

A smaller DecayFactor or WindowLength emphasizes recent data more strongly but uses less of
the available data set.
