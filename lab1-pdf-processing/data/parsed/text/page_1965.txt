exposureprofiles

Compute exposure profiles from credit exposures

Syntax

profilestructs = exposureprofiles(dates,exposures)
profilestructs = exposureprofiles( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

profilestructs = exposureprofiles(dates,exposures) computes common counterparty
credit exposures profiles from an array of exposures.

profilestructs = exposureprofiles( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional name-value
arguments.

Examples

View Exposure Profiles of a Particular Counterparty

After computing the mark-to-market contract values for a portfolio of swaps over many scenarios,
view the exposure profiles of a particular counterparty.

Load the data (ccr.mat) that contains the mark-to-market contract values for a portfolio of swaps
over many scenarios.

load ccr.mat

Compute the exposure by counterparty.

[exposures, expcpty] = creditexposures(values,swaps.Counterparty,...
'NettingID',swaps.NettingID);

Compute the credit exposure profiles for all counterparties.

cpProfiles = exposureprofiles(simulationDates,exposures)

cpProfiles=5Ã—1 struct array with fields:
    Dates
    EE
    PFE
    MPFE
    EffEE
    EPE
    EffEPE

Visualize the exposure profiles for a particular counterparty.

cpIdx = find(expcpty == 4);
numDates = numel(simulationDates);
