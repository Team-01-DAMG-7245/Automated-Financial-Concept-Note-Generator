Assume that there is a market index that follows the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio. Use
estimateMaxSharpeRatio to create the benchmark portfolio.

% Create the benchmark portfolio.
bmkPort = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p);
% Create the benchmark returns timetable.
marketTT = timetable(assetsTT.Time,assetsTT.Variables*bmkPort, ...
    VariableNames={'Benchmark'});

Minimize Tracking Error

You can use two methods to obtain the tracking error. The first method uses the variance of the
excess return of the portfolio with respect to the benchmark. This method assumes that the
benchmark prices or returns are given, but does not require knowledge of the weights of the assets
associated to the benchmark. The second method requires you to decompose the benchmark into the
different weights for each asset.

Tracking Error Using Benchmark Returns

To compute the tracking error, you first need to compute the excess return of each asset with respect
to the benchmark.

% Compute the excess return.
excessReturn = assetsTT.Variables-marketTT.Variables;

Then, you can compute the excess returns covariance matrix ΣR.

excessRetSigma = cov(excessReturn);

Compute the tracking error as the variance of the excess return of the portfolio
