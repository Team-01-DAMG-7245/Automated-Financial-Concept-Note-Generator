cev

Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) model

Description

Creates and displays a cev objects, which derives from the sdeld (SDE with drift rate expressed in
linear form) class.

Use cev objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables driven by NBrowns Brownian
motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-
time stochastic processes.

This model allows you to simulate any vector-valued CEV of the form:

dXt = μ(t)Xtdt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
μ is an NVars-by-NVars (generalized) expected instantaneous rate of return matrix.

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
corresponding element of the state vector raised to the corresponding power of α.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Creation

Syntax

CEV = cev(Return,Alpha,Sigma)
CEV = cev( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

CEV = cev(Return,Alpha,Sigma) creates a default CEV object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.

•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.

Note You can specify combinations of array and function input parameters as needed.
