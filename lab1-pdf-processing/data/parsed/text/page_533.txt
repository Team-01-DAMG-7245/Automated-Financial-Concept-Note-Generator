The GBWM portfolio is riskier than the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio. This extra risk is necessary
to maximize the probability of attaining the investor's wealth goal G by time T.

Compare GBWM Portfolio to Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

Compare the probabilities of achieving the wealth goal G by the end of the investment period T for
the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio against the GBWM portfolio.

The probability of successfully meeting the investor's wealth goal does not change much between the
maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio and the GBWM portfolio. Using this information, an investor can
understand the trade-off between achieving their wealth goal G by time T compared to choosing a
less risky portfolio. For example, an investor might choose a minimum variance portfolio that has a
much lower probability of achieving their wealth goal G by time T. Find the minimum variance (MV)
portfolio, and compare the probability of achieving the wealth goal using this portfolio with the other
two approaches.
