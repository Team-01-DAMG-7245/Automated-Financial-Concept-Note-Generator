Overview

Because base-level sde objects accept drift and diffusion objects in lieu of functions accessible by (t,
Xt), you can create sde objects with combinations of customized drift or diffusion functions and
objects. The drift and diffusion rate objects encapsulate the details of input parameters to
optimize run-time efficiency for any given combination of input parameters.

Although drift and diffusion objects differ in the details of their representation, they are
identical in their basic implementation and interface. They look, feel like, and are evaluated as
functions:

•
The drift object allows you to create drift-rate objects of the form:

F(t, Xt) = A(t) + B(t)Xt

where:

•
A is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

•
B is an NVars-by-NVars matrix-valued function accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

•
Similarly, the diffusion object allows you to create diffusion-rate objects:

G(t, Xt) = D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)

where:

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix-valued function.

•
Each diagonal element of D is the corresponding element of the state vector raised to the
corresponding element of an exponent Alpha, which is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued volatility rate function Sigma.

•
Alpha and Sigma are also accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

Note You can express drift and diffusion objects in the most general form to emphasize the
functional (t, Xt) interface. However, you can specify the components A and B as functions that
adhere to the common (t, Xt) interface, or as MATLAB arrays of appropriate dimension.

Specify Drift and Diffusion Rate Functions

In this example, you create drift and diffusion rate objects to create the same model as in
“Specify Base Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) Model” on page 14-16.

Create a drift-rate function F and a diffusion-rate function G.
