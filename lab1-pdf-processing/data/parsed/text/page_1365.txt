In this example, the efficient frontiers obtained using the traditional covariance estimate and the
shrunk estimate are close to each other. This means that both methods achieve similar risk and
returns out-of-sample. Where the difference between these methods is more noticeable is for the
portfolios to the left of the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio. For those portfolios, the allocation
computed using shrinkage has better returns out-of-sample.

Backtest to Compare Investment Strategy When Using Covariance Shrinkage

This example compares a minimum variance investment strategy using the traditional covariance
estimate with a minimum variance strategy using covariance shrinkage.

Load the data.

% Read a table of daily adjusted close prices for 2006 DJIA stocks.
T = readtable('dowPortfolio.xlsx');

% Convert the table to a timetable.
pricesTT = table2timetable(T,'RowTimes','Dates');
numAssets = size(pricesTT.Variables, 2);

Use the first 42 days of the dowPortfolio.xlsx data set to initialize the backtest strategies. The
backtest is then run over the remaining data.

warmupPeriod = 42;

Compute the initial weights. Use the traditionalStrat and shrunkStrat functions in Local
Functions on page 15-61 to compute the weights.

% Specify no current weights (100% cash position).
w0 = zeros(1,numAssets);
