States for Wealth Nodes

The states are defined as the wealth values at time t. To simplify the problem, discretize the wealth
values to generate a wealth grid, Wi, for i ∈
1, …, imax .W1 corresponds to the smallest possible
wealth Wmin and Wimax corresponds to the largest possible wealth Wmax. To determine Wmin and

Wmax, assume that the evolution of wealth follows a geometric Brownian motion

W t = W 0 e μ −σ 2/2 t + σ tZ,

where Z is a standard normal random variable. GBWM does not require that the wealth evolution
follow a Brownian motion. However, the technique in this example requires the evolution model to be
Markovian. Therefore, this example assumes that the probability of being at a certain state at time
t + 1 only depends on the state at time t and the action taken.

This example also assumes that Z realistically takes values between −3 and 3. When Z = −3, Wmin
corresponds to the smallest value obtained in the trajectory of the Brownian motion setting, μ is the
smallest possible portfolio return μmin, and σ is the largest possible portfolio risk σmax. Likewise,
when Z = 3, Wmax corresponds to the largest value in the trajectory, μ is the largest possible portfolio
return μmax, and σ is the largest possible portfolio risk σmax. For Wmax, use σmax because the term in

the exponential is increasing for all σ ≤3/ t; if σmax > 3/ t, use σ = 3/ t instead.

Define μmin, μmax, σmin, and σmax.

% Define return limits.
mu_min = pret(1);
mu_max = pret(end);

% Define volatility limits.
sigma_min = prsk(1);
sigma_max = prsk(end);
