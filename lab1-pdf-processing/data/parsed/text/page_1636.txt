Use simByEuler to simulate NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The
function simByEuler approximates a continuous-time stochastic process by the Euler approach.

NPeriods = 2;
[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler(roughbergomiObj,NPeriods)

Paths = 3×2

1.0000    0.2000
    1.1858    0.2054
    0.3962    0.2078

Paths is a 3-by-2 matrix and the output Z is a matrix used to generate the Brownian motion vector.

Simulate Rough Heston Model Sample Paths by Euler Approximation

The rough Heston model is a roughheston object that is a bivariate composite models, composed of
two coupled and dissimilar univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian motion source of risk
over NPERIODS consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time rough Heston
stochastic volatility processes..

Create an roughheston object.

Return = 0.1;
Speed = 0.2;
Level = 0.1;
Volatility = 0.05;
Alpha = -0.03;

roughhestonObj = roughheston(Return,Speed,Level,Volatility,Alpha)

roughhestonObj =
