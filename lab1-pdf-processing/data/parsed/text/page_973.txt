Credit Scorecard Modeling Using Observation Weights

When creating a creditscorecard object, the table used for the input data argument either
defines or does not define observational weights. If the data does not use weights, then the "counts"
for Good, Bad, and Odds are used by credit score card functions. However, if the optional
WeightsVar argument is specified when creating a creditscorecard object, then the "counts" for
Good, Bad, and Odds are the sum of weights.

For example, here is a snippet of an input table that does not define observational weights:

If you bin the customer age predictor data, with customers up to 45 years old in one bin, and 46 and
up in another bin, you get these statistics:

Good means the total number of rows with a 0 value in the status response variable. Bad the
number of 1â€™s in the status column. Odds is the ratio of Good to Bad. The Good, Bad, and Odds is
reported for each bin. This means that there are 381 people in the sample who are 45 and under who
paid their loans, 241 in the same age range who defaulted, and therefore, the odds of being good for
that age range is 1.581.

Suppose that the modeler thinks that people 45 and younger are underrepresented in this sample.
The modeler wants to give all rows with ages up to 45 a higher weight. Assume that the modeler
thinks the up to 45 age group should have 50% more weight than rows with ages 46 and up. The
table data is expanded to include the observation weights. A Weight column is added to the table,
where all rows with ages 45 and under have a weight of 1.5, and all other rows a weight of 1. There
are other reasons to use weights, for example, recent data points may be given higher weights than
older data points.
