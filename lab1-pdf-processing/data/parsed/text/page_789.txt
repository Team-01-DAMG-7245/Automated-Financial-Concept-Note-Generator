Linear Equality Constraints

Linear equality constraints are general linear constraints that model relationships among portfolio
weights that satisfy a system of equalities. Linear equality constraints take the form

AEx = bE

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

AE is the linear equality constraint matrix (nE-by-n matrix).

bE is the linear equality constraint vector (nE vector).

n is the number of assets in the universe and nE is the number of constraints.

PortfolioMAD object properties to specify linear equality constraints are:

•
AEquality for AE
•
bEquality for bE
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore these constraints.

'Simple' Bound Constraints

'Simple' Bound constraints are specialized linear constraints that confine portfolio weights to fall
either above or below specific bounds. Since every portfolio set must be bounded, it is often a good
practice, albeit not necessary, to set explicit bounds for the portfolio problem. To obtain explicit
bounds for a given portfolio set, use the estimateBounds function. Bound constraints take the form

lB ≤x ≤uB

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

lB is the lower-bound constraint (n vector).

uB is the upper-bound constraint (n vector).

n is the number of assets in the universe.

PortfolioMAD object properties to specify bound constraints are:

•
LowerBound for lB
•
UpperBound for uB
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore these constraints.
