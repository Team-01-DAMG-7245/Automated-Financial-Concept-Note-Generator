cfyield

Compute yield to maturity for cash flow given price

Syntax

Yield = cfyield(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,Price,Settle)
Yield = cfyield( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Yield = cfyield(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,Price,Settle) computes yield to maturity for
a cash flow given price.

Yield = cfyield( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more name-value pair
arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Compute the Yield to Maturity for a Cash Flow When Given a Price

Use cfyield to compute yield to maturity for a cash flow when given a price.

Define data for the yield curve and price.

Settle = datetime(2003,7,1);
Price = 98;
CFlowAmounts = [30 40 30];
CFlowDates = [datetime(2004,7,15) ; datetime(2005,7,15) ; datetime(2006,7,15)]';

Compute the Yield.

Yield = cfyield(CFlowAmounts, CFlowDates, Price, Settle)

Yield = 
0.0099

Input Arguments

CFlowAmounts — Cash flow amounts
vector

Cash flow amounts, specified as an NINST-by-MOSTCFS matrix. Each row is a list of cash flow values
for one instrument. If an instrument has fewer than MOSTCFS cash flows, the end of the row is padded
with NaNs.

Data Types: double

CFlowDates — Cash flow dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector
