The prices matrix is 5-by-3, the quantity matrix (vector) is 3-by-1, so the resulting matrix (vector) is 5-
by-1.

Multiplying Two Matrices

Matrix multiplication also follows the rules of matrix algebra. In matrix algebra notation, if A is an m-
by-n matrix and B is an n-by-p matrix

A =

a11 a12 ⋯a1n
⋮
⋮
⋮
ai1
ai2 ⋯ain
⋮
⋮
⋮
am1 am2 ⋯amn

,   B =

b11 ⋯b1 j ⋯b1p
b21 ⋯b2 j ⋯b2p
⋮
⋮
⋮
bn1 ⋯bn j ⋯bnp

then C = A*B is an m-by-p matrix; and the element cij in the ith row and jth column of C is

ci j = ai1b1 j + ai2b12 + … + ainbn j .

To illustrate, assume that there are two portfolios of the same three stocks previously mentioned but
with different quantities.

Portfolios = [100   200
              500   400
              300   150];

Multiplying the 5-by-3 week's closing prices matrix by the 3-by-2 portfolios matrix yields a 5-by-2
matrix showing each day's closing value for both portfolios.

PortfolioValues = WeekClosePr * Portfolios

PortfolioValues =

1.0e+004 *

Monday's values result from multiplying each Monday closing price by its respective number of
shares and summing the result for the first portfolio, then doing the same for the second portfolio.
Tuesday's values result from multiplying each Tuesday closing price by its respective number of
shares and summing the result for the first portfolio, then doing the same for the second portfolio.
And so on, through the rest of the week. With one simple command, MATLAB quickly performs many
calculations.

Multiplying a Matrix by a Scalar

Multiplying a matrix by a scalar is an exception to the dimension and commutative rules. It just
operates element-by-element.
