cpndaysp

Number of days since previous coupon date

Syntax

NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp(Settle,Maturity)
NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate)

Description

NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp(Settle,Maturity) returns the number of days between the
previous coupon date and the settlement date for a bond or set of bonds. When the coupon frequency
is 0 (a zero coupon bond), the previous coupon date is calculated as if the frequency were
semiannual. NumDaysPrevious returns a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector containing the number of days from
the previous coupon date to settlement.

Required input arguments must be number of bonds, NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS, conforming
vectors or scalars.

NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate) returns the number of days between the previous coupon
date and the settlement date for a bond or set of bonds using optional input arguments.

Optional input arguments must be either NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS conforming vectors,
scalars, or empty matrices.

Examples

Calculate the Number of Days Between Previous Coupon Date and Settlement Date

Determine the NumDaysPrevious when using datetimes for input arguments.

NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp(datetime(2000,3,14),datetime(2001,6,30), 2, 0, 0)

NumDaysPrevious = 
75

Determine the NumDaysPrevious when using character vectors for input arguments and the
optional argument for EndMonthRule.

NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp('14-Mar-2000','30-Jun-2001', 2, 0, 1)

NumDaysPrevious = 
74

Determine the NumDaysPrevious when using a datetime array for Maturity.

Maturity = [datetime(2001,4,30) ; datetime(2001,5,31) ; datetime(2001,6,30)];
NumDaysPrevious = cpndaysp(datetime(2000,3,14), Maturity)
