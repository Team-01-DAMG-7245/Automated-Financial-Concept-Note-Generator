Based on the moments of each asset, the expected values for lower partial moments imply better than
expected performance for the fund and market and worse than expected performance for cash. The
elpm function works with either degenerate or nondegenerate normal random variables. For
example, if cash were truly riskless, its standard deviation would be 0. You can examine the
difference in average shortfall.

RisklessCash = elpm(Mean(3), 0, MAR, 1)

RisklessCash = 
0

Input Arguments

Mean — Mean returns
vector

Mean returns, specified as a NUMSERIES vector with mean returns for a collection of NUMSERIES
assets.

Data Types: double

Sigma — Standard deviation of returns
vector

Standard deviation of returns, specified as a NUMSERIES vector with standard deviation of returns for
a collection of NUMSERIES assets.

Data Types: double

MAR — Minimum acceptable return
0 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Minimum acceptable return, specified as a scalar numeric. MAR is a cutoff level of return
such that all returns above MAR contribute nothing to the lower partial moment.

Data Types: double

Order — Moment orders
0 (default) | scalar numeric | vector
