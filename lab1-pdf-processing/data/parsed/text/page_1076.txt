Troubleshooting Multivariate Normal Regression

This section provides a few pointers to handle various technical and operational difficulties that might
occur.

Biased Estimates

If samples are ignored, the number of samples used in the estimation is less than NumSamples.
Clearly the actual number of samples used must be sufficient to obtain estimates. In addition,
although the model parameters Parameters (or mean estimates Mean) are unbiased maximum
likelihood estimates, the residual covariance estimate Covariance is biased. To convert to an
unbiased covariance estimate, multiply Covariance by

Count/ Count−1 ,

where Count is the actual number of samples used in the estimation with Count ≤ NumSamples.
None of the regression functions perform this adjustment.

Requirements

The regression functions, particularly the estimation functions, have several requirements. First, they
must have consistent values for NumSamples, NumSeries, and NumParams. As a rule, the
multivariate normal regression functions require

Count × NumSeries ≤max NumParams,  NumSeries × NumSeries+1 /2

and the least-squares regression functions require

Count × NumSeries ≤NumParams,

where Count is the actual number of samples used in the estimation with

Count≤NumSamples.

Second, they must have enough nonmissing values to converge. Third, they must have a
nondegenerate covariance matrix.

Although some necessary and sufficient conditions can be found in the references, general conditions
for existence and uniqueness of solutions in the missing-data case, do not exist. Nonconvergence is
usually due to an ill-conditioned covariance matrix estimate, which is discussed in greater detail in
“Nonconvergence” on page 9-19.

Slow Convergence

Since worst-case convergence of the ECM algorithm is linear, it is possible to execute hundreds and
even thousands of iterations before termination of the algorithm. If you are estimating with the ECM
algorithm regularly with regular updates, you can use prior estimates as initial guesses for the next
period's estimation. This approach often speeds up things since the default initialization in the
regression functions sets the initial parameters b to zero and the initial covariance C to be the
identity matrix.
