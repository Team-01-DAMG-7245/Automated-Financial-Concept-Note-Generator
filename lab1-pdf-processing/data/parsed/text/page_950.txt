The following plot keeps track of cumulative square error, a measure often used for comparisons in
backtesting exercises. This confirms TTC as a poor alternative. PIT shows lower cumulative error
than the linear regression model in the late nineties, but after the 2001 recession the situation is
reversed. Cumulative square error, however, is not an intuitive measure, it is hard to get a sense of
what the difference between these alternatives means in practical terms.

CumSqError = cumsum(ErrorBT.^2);
