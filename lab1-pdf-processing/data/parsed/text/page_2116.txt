datewrkdy

Date of future or past workday

Syntax

EndDate = datewrkdy(StartDate,NumberWorkDays,NumberHolidays)

Description

EndDate = datewrkdy(StartDate,NumberWorkDays,NumberHolidays) returns the datetime
of the date a given number of workdays before or after the start date.

Any input can contain multiple values, but if so, all other inputs must contain the same number of
values or a single value that applies to all.

For example, if StartDate is an n-row datetime, then NumberWorkDays must be an N-by-1 vector of
integers or a single integer. EndDate is then an N-by-1 vector of datetimes.

If StartDate is a string or date character vector, EndDate is returned as a serial date number. Use
the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If StartDate is a datetime array, then EndDate is returned as a datetime array.
