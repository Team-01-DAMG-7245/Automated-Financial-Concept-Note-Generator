•
As required, the duration and convexity of the new portfolio are 10.3181 and 157.6346,
respectively.

•
The hedge amounts for bonds 1, 2, and 3 are -57.37, 71.70, and 216.27, respectively.

Notice that the hedge matches the duration, convexity, and value ($100,000) of the original portfolio.
If you are holding that first portfolio, you can hedge by taking a short position in the new portfolio.

Just as the approximations of the example in “Sensitivity of Bond Prices to Interest Rates” on page
10-2 are appropriate only for small parallel shifts in the yield curve, the hedge portfolio is appropriate
only for reducing the impact of small level changes in the term structure.
