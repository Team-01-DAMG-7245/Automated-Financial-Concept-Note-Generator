Looking at the Maximum Factor Loadings heatmap, you can see:

•
Coffee, tea, groundnut oil, palm oil, bananas, and wood have a strong association with latent
factor 1.

•
Coconut oil, soybeans, maize, rice, wheat, chicken, cotton, and rubber have a strong association
with latent factor 2.

•
Latent factor 3 is associated with cocoa, soybean oil, soybean meal, oranges, beef, shrimps, sugar,
and tobacco.

•
The strongest negative association in the loadings matrix is chicken with latent factor 3. Other
loadings for chicken are relatively low, indicating that chicken volatility is an outlier in this data
set, as you can also observe by using other methods.

Estimate Model-Based Volatility

One disadvantage of using the exponentially weighted moving average for volatility estimation is that
it does not provide volatility forecasts. However, you can use a model-based approach to create
volatility forecasts. This example uses arima (Econometrics Toolbox) and garch (Econometrics
Toolbox) time-series models.

Compute Principal Components of Inferred Volatility

First, use normalize on the volatility series and store the mean and standard deviation for later use.

[normalizedVolatility, mu, sigma] = normalize( InferredVolatility.Variables, "zscore" );

Next, compute the principal components by using pca.
