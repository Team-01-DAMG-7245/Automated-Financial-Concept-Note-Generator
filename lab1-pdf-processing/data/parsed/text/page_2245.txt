The estimateBounds function returns (possibly infinite) bounds and sets the isbounded flag to
false. The result shows which assets are unbounded so that you can apply bound constraints as
necessary.

Input Arguments

obj — Object for portfolio
object

Object for portfolio, specified using Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object. For
more information on creating a portfolio object, see

•
Portfolio

•
PortfolioCVaR

•
PortfolioMAD

Data Types: object

obtainExactBounds — Flag to specify whether to solve for all bounds or to accept specified
bounds whenever available
true (default) | logical

Flag to specify whether to solve for all bounds or to accept specified bounds whenever available,
specified as a logical with values of true or false. If bounds are known, set obtainExactBounds
to false to accept known bounds. The default for obtainExactBounds is true.

Data Types: logical

Output Arguments

glb — Global lower bounds for portfolio set
vector

Global lower bounds for portfolio set, returned as vector for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

gub — Global upper bounds for portfolio set
vector

Global upper bounds for portfolio set, returned as vector for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

isbounded — Indicator for whether portfolio set is empty, bounded, or unbounded
logical

Indicator for whether portfolio set is empty ([]), bounded (true), or unbounded (false), returned as
a logical.

Note By definition, any portfolio set must be nonempty and bounded:

•
If the set is empty, isbounded = [ ].
