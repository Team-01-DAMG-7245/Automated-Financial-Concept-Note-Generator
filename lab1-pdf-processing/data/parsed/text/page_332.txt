Note that cash actually has a small risk so that the tangent line does not pass through the cash asset.

Obtain Range of Risks and Returns

To obtain efficient portfolios with target values of either risk or return, it is necessary to obtain the
range of risks and returns among all portfolios on the efficient frontier. This is accomplished with the
estimateFrontierLimits function.

[rsk,ret] = estimatePortMoments(p,estimateFrontierLimits(p));

display(rsk)

rsk = 2×1

0.0348
    0.0903

display(ret)

ret = 2×1

0.0094
    0.0179

The range of monthly portfolio returns is between 0.9% and 1.8% and the range for portfolio risks is
between 3.5% and 9.0%. In annualized terms, the range of portfolio returns is 11.2% to 21.5% and
the range of portfolio risks is 12.1% to 31.3%.
