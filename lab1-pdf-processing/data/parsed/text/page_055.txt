Introduction

Financial Toolbox cash-flow functions compute interest rates and rates of return, present or future
values, depreciation streams, and annuities.

Some examples in this section use this income stream: an initial investment of $20,000 followed by
three annual return payments, a second investment of $5,000, then four more returns. Investments
are negative cash flows, return payments are positive cash flows.

Stream = [-20000,  2000,  2500,  3500, -5000,  6500,...
            9500,  9500,  9500];

Interest Rates/Rates of Return

This example shows how to compute the internal rate of return of the cash stream using irr.

Specify the income stream as an initial investment of $20,000 followed by three annual return
payments, a second investment of $5,000, then four more returns. Investments are negative cash
flows, return payments are positive cash flows.

Stream = [-20000,  2000,  2500,  3500, -5000,  6500, ...
            9500,  9500,  9500];

Use irr to compute the internal rate of return of the cash stream.

ROR = irr(Stream)

ROR = 
0.1172

The rate of return is 11.72%.

The internal rate of return of a cash flow may not have a unique value. Every time the sign changes in
a cash flow, the equation defining irr can give up to two additional answers. An irr computation
requires solving a polynomial equation, and the number of real roots of such an equation can depend
on the number of sign changes in the coefficients. The equation for internal rate of return is

where Investment is a (negative) initial cash outlay at time 0, cfn is the cash flow in the nth period,
and n is the number of periods. irr finds the rate r such that the present value of the cash flow
