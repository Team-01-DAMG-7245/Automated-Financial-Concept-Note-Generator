The paths are close but not exact. The blue line in the last plot uses all the historical Euribor data,
and illustrates a single trial of a historical simulation.

Price European Stock Options Using Monte Carlo Simulation

As discussed in “Simulate Positive Interest Rates” on page 14-54, all simulation and interpolation
methods allow you to specify one or more functions of the form:

to evaluate at the end of every sample time.

The related example illustrates a simple, common end-of-period processing function to ensure
nonnegative interest rates. This example illustrates a processing function that allows you to avoid
simulation outputs altogether.

Consider pricing European stock options by Monte Carlo simulation within a Black-Scholes-Merton
framework. Assume that the stock has the following characteristics:

•
The stock currently trades at 100.

•
The stock pays no dividends.

•
The stock's volatility is 50% per annum.

•
The option strike price is 95.

•
The option expires in three months.

•
The risk-free rate is constant at 10% per annum.
