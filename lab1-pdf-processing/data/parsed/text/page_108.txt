Continuous Time Markov Process

Together, the state of the LOB imbalance index rho (ρ) and the state of the forward price movement
DS (ΔS) describe a two-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). The chain is modulated
by the Poisson process of order arrivals, which signals any transition among the states.

To simplify the description, give the two-dimensional CTMC a one-dimensional encoding into states
phi (φ = ρ, ΔS ).

numStates = 3*numBins; % numStates(DS)*numStates(rho)

phi = NaN(size(t));
for i = 1:length(t)
    switch DS(i)
        case -1
            phi(i) = rho(i);
        case 0
            phi(i) = rho(i) + numBins;
        case 1
            phi(i) = rho(i) + 2*numBins;
    end
end

Successive states of φ, and the component states ρ and ΔS, proceed as follows.
