getBounds

Obtain bounds for portfolio weights from portfolio object

Syntax

[LowerBound,UpperBound] = getBounds(obj)

Description

Use the getBounds function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain bounds for portfolio weights from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[LowerBound,UpperBound] = getBounds(obj) obtains bounds for portfolio weights from
portfolio objects.

Examples

Obtain Values for Lower and Upper Bounds for a Portfolio Object

Given portfolio p with the default constraints set, obtain the values for LowerBound and
UpperBound.

p = Portfolio;
p = setDefaultConstraints(p, 5);
[LowerBound, UpperBound] = getBounds(p)

LowerBound = 5×1
