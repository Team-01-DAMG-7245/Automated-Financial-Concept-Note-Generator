The lower and upper tail regions, displayed in red and blue, respectively, are suitable for
extrapolation, while the kernel-smoothed interior, in black, is suitable for interpolation.

Copula Calibration

The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox software includes functionality that calibrates and
simulates Gaussian and t copulas.

Using the daily index returns, estimate the parameters of the Gaussian and t copulas using the
function copulafit. Since a t copula becomes a Gaussian copula as the scalar degrees of freedom
parameter (DoF) becomes infinitely large, the two copulas are really of the same family, and therefore
share a linear correlation matrix as a fundamental parameter.

Although calibration of the linear correlation matrix of a Gaussian copula is straightforward, the
calibration of a t copula is not. For this reason, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox software
offers two techniques to calibrate a t copula:

â€¢
The first technique performs maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in a two-step process. The
inner step maximizes the log-likelihood with respect to the linear correlation matrix, given a fixed
value for the degrees of freedom. This conditional maximization is placed within a 1-D
maximization with respect to the degrees of freedom, thus maximizing the log-likelihood over all
