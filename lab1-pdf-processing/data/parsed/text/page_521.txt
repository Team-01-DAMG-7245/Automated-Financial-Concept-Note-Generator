Define the warmup period to compute the initial portfolios for the different strategies using the data
in that period.

% Set backtesting warmup period to two 21-day months.
warmupPeriod = 21*2;
% Set a warmup partition of the timetable.
warmupTT = pricesTT(1:warmupPeriod,:);

Compute the initial portfolios using the rebalancing functions (markowitzFcn and robustFcn) that
are defined in Local Functions on page 4-356.

% Define the initial Markowitz portfolio.
initialMarkowitz = markowitzFcn(zeros(p.NumAssets,1),warmupTT,p);
% Define the initial robust portfolio.
initialRP = robustFcn(zeros(p.NumAssets,1),warmupTT,p,kappa);

Plot both types of portfolios to compare the initial behavior.

% Plot the initial portfolios.

title('Markowitz vs. Robust Allocation')

Out of 30 assets in the Markowitz allocation, 29 are at the extremes of the feasible bounds. On the
other hand, only 17 assets in the robust allocation are at their extremes. The number of assets at the
extremes of the feasible bounds shows the sensitivity of the traditional maximum return allocation
strategy to the parameters of the problem. The Markowitz strategy invests everything possible in the
assets with the highest returns. This result means that the Markowitz strategy shorts the assets with
the lowest returns to be able to allocate more to the assets with the largest returns. On the other
hand, the robust strategy does not have the same extreme behavior.
