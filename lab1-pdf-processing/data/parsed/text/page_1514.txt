Examples

Create merton Object

Merton jump diffusion models allow you to simulate sample paths of NVARS state variables driven by
NBROWNS Brownian motion sources of risk and NJumps compound Poisson processes representing the
arrivals of important events over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The simulation
approximates continuous-time merton stochastic processes.

Create a merton object.
