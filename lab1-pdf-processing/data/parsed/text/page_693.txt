Notice that addGroupRatio determines which bounds are unbounded so you only need to focus on
the constraints you want to set.

The PortfolioCVaR object, setGroupRatio, and addGroupRatio implement scalar expansion on
either the LowerRatio or UpperRatio properties based on the dimension of the group matrices in
GroupA and GroupB properties.
