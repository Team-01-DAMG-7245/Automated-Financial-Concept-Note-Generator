Very different predictor values result in similar default rate levels. For example, consider a profits
forecast around 10% with a spread of 3.5%, and a profits forecast of -2.5% with a spread of 2%, they
both result in a default rate slightly above 3%. Also, only one point in the available history yields a
default rate higher than 4%.

Monetary terms, once again, may be more meaningful. Use the Basel II capital requirements formula
(see [2 on page 8-43]) to translate the default rates into a monetary measure. The Basel II formula is
convenient because it is analytic (there is no need to simulate to estimate the capital requirements),
but also because it depends only on the probabilities of default. Define the Basel II capital
requirements as a function K.

% Correlation as a function of PD
w = @(pd) (1-exp(-50*pd))/(1-exp(-50)); % weight
R = @(pd) (0.12*w(pd)+0.24*(1-w(pd))); % correlation
% Vasicek formula
V = @(pd) normcdf(norminv(pd)+R(pd).*norminv(0.999)./sqrt(1-R(pd)));
% Parameter b for maturity adjustment
b = @(pd) (0.11852-0.05478*log(pd)).^2;
% Basel II capital requirement with LGD=45% and maturity M=2.5 (numerator
% in maturity adjustment term becomes 1)
K = @(pd) 0.45*(V(pd)-pd).*(1./(1-1.5*b(pd)));

Worst-case default rates for a whole grid of CPF - SPR pairs are stored in DefRateUB. By applying the
function K to DefRateUB, you can visualize the capital requirements over the same grid.

CapReq = 100*K(DefRateUB/100);
Example_StressTestPlot(gridCPF,gridSPR,CapReq,CPF,SPR,...
   'Corporate Profits Forecast (%)','Corporate Spread (%)',...
   {'{\bf Capital Requirement Regions (% of value)}';...
