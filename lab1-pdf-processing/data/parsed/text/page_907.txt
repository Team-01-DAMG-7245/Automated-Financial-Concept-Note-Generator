Using the Information Ratio

This example shows how to use the information ratio to calculate the ratio of relative return to
relative risk.

Although originally called the "appraisal ratio" by Treynor and Black, the information ratio is the ratio
of relative return to relative risk (known as "tracking error"). Whereas the Sharpe ratio looks at
returns relative to a riskless asset, the information ratio is based on returns relative to a risky
benchmark which is known colloquially as a "bogey." Given an asset or portfolio of assets with
random returns designated by Asset and a benchmark with random returns designated by
Benchmark, the information ratio has the form:

Mean(Asset − Benchmark) / Sigma (Asset − Benchmark)

Here Mean(Asset − Benchmark) is the mean of Asset minus Benchmark returns, and
Sigma(Asset - Benchmark) is the standard deviation of Asset minus Benchmark returns. A
higher information ratio is considered better than a lower information ratio. For more information,
see inforatio.

To calculate the information ratio using the example data, the mean return of the market series is
used as the return of the benchmark. Thus, given asset return data and the riskless asset return,
compute the information ratio with

load FundMarketCash 
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
Benchmark = Returns(:,2);
InfoRatio = inforatio(Returns, Benchmark)

InfoRatio = 1×3

0.0432       NaN   -0.0315

Since the market series has no risk relative to itself, the information ratio for the second series is
undefined (which is represented as NaN in MATLAB® software). Its standard deviation of relative
returns in the denominator is 0.
