bound of the objective function. If ObjectiveBound is not specified, a numerical lower bound is
computed.

Data Types: double

InitialPoint — Weights allocation to initialize solver
[] (default) | vector

Weights allocation to initialize solver, specified as InitialPoint and a NumAssets-by-1 vector.
InitialPoint is useful for continuous portfolio problems that may have many local minima. By
specifying a starting point, you can make the algorithm search different local minima.

Note If InitialPoint is not specified, it is set to the long-only, fully-invested, equally-weighted
portfolio.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

pwgt — Optimal weight allocation of portfolio problem
vector

Optimal weight allocation of the portfolio problem, returned as a NumAssets-by-1 vector.

pbuy — Purchases relative to initial portfolio to achieve optimal weight allocation of
portfolio problem
vector

Purchases relative to initial portfolio to achieve the optimal weight allocation of the portfolio problem,
returned as a NumAssets-by-1 vector.

psell — Sales relative to initial portfolio to achieve optimal weight allocation of the
portfolio problem
vector

Sales relative to initial portfolio to achieve the optimal weight allocation of the portfolio problem,
returned as a NumAssets vector.

exitflag — Reason solver stopped
enumeration variable | integer

Reason the solver stopped, returned as an enumeration variable or integer. There are two types of
exitflag output. If the problem is continuous, the exitflag output is an enumeration variable. If
the problem is mixed-integer, then the exitflag output is an integer.
