and covariance, use elpm. With lpm, you can compute various investment ratios such as Omega ratio,
Sortino ratio, and Upside Potential ratio, where:

•
Omega = lpm(-Data, -MAR, 1) / lpm(Data, MAR, 1)

•
Sortino = (mean(Data) - MAR) / sqrt(lpm(Data, MAR, 2))

•
Upside = lpm(-Data, -MAR, 1) / sqrt(lpm(Data, MAR, 2))

More About

Lower Partial Moments

Use lower partial moments to examine what is colloquially known as “downside risk.”

The main idea of the lower partial moment framework is to model moments of asset returns that fall
below a minimum acceptable level of return. To compute lower partial moments from data, use lpm to
calculate lower partial moments for multiple asset return series and for multiple moment orders. To
compute expected values for lower partial moments under several assumptions about the distribution
of asset returns, use elpm to calculate lower partial moments for multiple assets and for multiple
orders.
