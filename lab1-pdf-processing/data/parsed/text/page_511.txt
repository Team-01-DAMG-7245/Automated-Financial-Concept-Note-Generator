Solve Tracking Error Portfolio Problems

This example shows how to compute a portfolio that minimizes the tracking error subject to a
benchmark portfolio. This example uses estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio to solve a problem
for a minimum variance Portfolio with a tracking error penalty. The example also shows how to
add the tracking error as a "soft constraint" to any portfolio optimization problem. The tracking error
measures the standard deviation of the divergence between a portfolio's return and that of a
benchmark.

Define the mean and covariance of the assets returns.

% Define the assets mean.
mu = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
% Define the assets covariance.
Sigma = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
        0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
        0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
        0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

Simulate a timeseries of assets returns with mean mu and covariance Sigma. From this point onward,
assume that the true mean and covariance are not known and they can only be estimated from the
timetable data.

% Find all business days of the last two years.
tEnd = datetime('today');
bdates = busdays(tEnd-calyears(2),tEnd);
% Create a simulated timetable.
rng('default')
nScen = size(bdates,1);
assetsTT = array2timetable(mvnrnd(mu,Sigma,nScen),RowTimes=bdates);

Define a long-only, fully invested portfolio problem using Portfolio.

% Define a Portfolio object.
p = Portfolio;
p = estimateAssetMoments(p,assetsTT);
% Specify constraints for a long-only, fully invested portfolio.
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
plotFrontier(p);
