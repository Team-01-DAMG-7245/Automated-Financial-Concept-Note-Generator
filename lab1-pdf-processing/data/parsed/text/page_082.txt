Conclusion

Complex continuous returns are a necessary intermediary when considering logarithms of negative
price ratios. tick2ret computes a continuous complex extension of the function on the positive real
axis. The logarithm maintains the additivity property, used when computing multiperiod returns.

Because of the extensible logarithm implemented in MATLAB, current implementations of
Computational Finance tools that accept prices and returns behave logically with negative prices. The
interpretation of complex-valued results can be unfamiliar at first, but as shown, the results are
meaningful and explicable.
