when no accrued premiums are paid upon default, and it can be approximated by

RPV01 ≈1
2 ∑
j = 1

N
Z(t j)Δ(t j −1, t j, B)(Q(t j −1) + Q(t j))

when accrued premiums are paid upon default. Here, t0 = 0 is the valuation date, and t1,...,tn = T are
the premium payment dates over the life of the contract,T is the maturity of the contract, Z(t) is the
discount factor for a payment received at time t, and Δ(tj-1, tj, B) is a day count between dates tj-1 and
tj corresponding to a basis B.

The protection leg of a CDS contract is given by the following formula:

ProtectionLeg =∫0

T
Z(τ)(1 −R)dPD(τ)

≈(1 −R) ∑
i = 1

M
Z(τi)(PD(τi) −PD(τi −1))

= (1 −R) ∑
i = 1

M
Z(τi)(Q(τi −1) −Q(τi))

where the integral is approximated with a finite sum over the discretization τ0 = 0,τ1,...,τM = T.

A breakeven spread S0 makes the value of the premium and protection legs equal. It follows that:

S0 = ProtectionLeg

Introduced in R2010b

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cdsspread supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
