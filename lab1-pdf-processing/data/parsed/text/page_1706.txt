QuasiSequence — Low discrepancy sequence to drive stochastic processes
"sobol" (default) | string with value "sobol" | character vector with value 'sobol'

Low discrepancy sequence to drive the stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'QuasiSequence' and a string or character vector with the following value:

•
"sobol" — Quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences that use a base of two to form successively
finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension

Note If MonteCarloMethod option is not specified or specified as"standard", QuasiSequence is
ignored.

BrownianMotionMethod — Brownian motion construction method
"standard" (default) | string with value "brownian-bridge" or "principal-components" |
character vector with value 'brownian-bridge' or 'principal-components'

Brownian motion construction method, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BrownianMotionMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following values:

•
"standard" — The Brownian motion path is found by taking the cumulative sum of the Gaussian
variates.

•
"brownian-bridge" — The last step of the Brownian motion path is calculated first, followed by
any order between steps until all steps have been determined.

•
"principal-components" — The Brownian motion path is calculated by minimizing the
approximation error.

The starting point for a Monte Carlo simulation is the construction of a Brownian motion sample path
(or Wiener path). Such paths are built from a set of independent Gaussian variates, using either
standard discretization, Brownian-bridge construction, or principal components construction.

Both standard discretization and Brownian-bridge construction share the same variance and,
therefore, the same resulting convergence when used with the MonteCarloMethod using pseudo
random numbers. However, the performance differs between the two when the MonteCarloMethod
option "quasi" is introduced, with faster convergence seen for "brownian-bridge" construction
option and the fastest convergence when using the "principal-components" construction option.
