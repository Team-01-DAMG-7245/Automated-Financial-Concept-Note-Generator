•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Output Arguments

DriftRate — Drift rate model component
DriftRate object

Drift rate model component, returned as a DriftRate object.

Properties

Rate — Composite drift-rate function
value stored from drift-rate function (default) | function accessible by F(t,Xt)

This property is read-only.

Composite drift-rate function, specified as F(t,Xt). The function stored in Rate fully encapsulates the
combined effect of A and B, where A and B are:

•
A: The intercept term, A(t,Xt), of F(t,Xt)

•
B: The first order term, B(t,Xt), of F(t,Xt)

Data Types: struct | double

Examples

Create a drift Object

Create a drift-rate function F:

F = drift(0, 0.1)   % Drift rate function F(t,X)

F = 
   Class DRIFT: Drift Rate Specification  
   -------------------------------------  
      Rate: drift rate function F(t,X(t)) 
         A: 0
         B: 0.1

The drift object displays like a MATLAB® structure and contains supplemental information, namely,
the object's class and a brief description. However, in contrast to the SDE representation, a summary
of the dimensionality of the model does not appear, because the drift class creates a model
component rather than a model. F does not contain enough information to characterize the
dimensionality of a problem.
