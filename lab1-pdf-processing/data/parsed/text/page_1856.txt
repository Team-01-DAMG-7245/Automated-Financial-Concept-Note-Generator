Bond duration represents the weighted average time until a bond's cash flows (interest and principal
payments) are received. Duration is a critical concept in fixed-income investing because it helps
investors assess the interest-rate risk associated with a bond or a bond portfolio.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although bnddury supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.

R2017b: Support for optional name-value input arguments
Behavior changed in R2017b

The specification of optional input arguments has changed. While the previous ordered inputs syntax
is still supported, it may no longer be supported in a future release. Use the optional name-value pair
inputs: Period, Basis, EndMonthRule, IssueDate,FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate,
StartDate,Face, CompoundingFrequency, DiscountBasis, and LastCouponInterest.
