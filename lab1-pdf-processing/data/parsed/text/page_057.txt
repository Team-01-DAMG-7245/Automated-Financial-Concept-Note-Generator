Depreciation

This example shows how to compute standard depreciation schedules using depgendb.

The following code depreciates an automobile worth $15,000 over five years with a salvage value of
$1,500. It computes the general declining balance using two different depreciation rates: 50% (or
1.5), and 100% (or 2.0, also known as double declining balance).

Decline1 = depgendb(15000, 1500, 5, 1.5)

Decline1 = 1×5
103 ×

4.5000    3.1500    2.2050    1.5435    2.1015

Decline2 = depgendb(15000, 1500, 5, 2.0)

Decline2 = 1×5
103 ×

6.0000    3.6000    2.1600    1.2960    0.4440

These results indicate the actual depreciation amount for the first four years and the remaining
depreciable value as the entry for the fifth year.

Annuities

This example shows how to work with annuities using annurate.

The following code shows how to compute the interest rate associated with a series of loan payments
when only the payment amounts and principal are known. For a loan whose original value was
$5000.00 and which was paid back monthly over four years at $130.00/month:

Rate = annurate(4*12, 130, 5000, 0, 0)

Rate = 
0.0094

The function returns a rate of 0.0094 monthly, or about 11.28% annually.

You can use a present-value function (pvfix) to compute the initial principal when the payment and
rate are known. For a loan paid at $300.00/month over four years at 11% annual interest:

Principal = pvfix(0.11/12, 4*12, 300, 0, 0)

Principal = 
1.1607e+04

The function returns the original principal value of $11,607.43.
