ModDuration = 
1.6107

YearDuration = 
1.6470

PerDuration = 
3.2940

The durations are:

•
ModDuration = 1.6107 (years)

•
YearDuration = 1.6470 (years)

•
PerDuration = 3.2940 (semiannual periods)

Note that the semiannual periodic Macaulay duration (PerDuration) is twice the annualized
Macaulay duration (YearDuration).

Calculating Key Rate Durations for Bonds

This example shows how to compute the key rate duration of the US Treasury Bond.

Key rate duration enables you to evaluate the sensitivity and price of a bond to nonparallel changes in
the spot or zero curve by decomposing the interest rate risk along the spot or zero curve. Key rate
duration refers to the process of choosing a set of key rates and computing a duration for each rate.
Specifically, for each key rate, while the other rates are held constant, the key rate is shifted up and
down (and intermediate cash flow dates are interpolated), and then the present value of the security
given the shifted curves is computed.

The calculation of bndkrdur supports

Where PV is the current value of the instrument, PV_up and PV_down are the new values after the
discount curve has been shocked, and ShiftValue is the change in interest rate. For example, if key
rates of 3 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years were chosen, then a 30-year bond might have
corresponding key rate durations of:

3M
1Y
2Y
3Y
5Y
7Y
10Y
15Y
20Y
25Y

The key rate durations add up to approximately equal the duration of the bond.

Compute the key rate duration of the US Treasury Bond with maturity date of August 15, 2028 and
coupon rate of 5.5%.

Settle = datenum('18-Nov-2008'); 
CouponRate = 5.500/100;
Maturity = datenum('15-Aug-2028'); 
Price = 114.83;
