Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: backtester =
backtestEngine(strategies,'RiskFreeRate',0.02,'InitialPortfolioValue',1000,'R
atesConvention',"Annualized",'Basis',2)

RiskFreeRate — Risk free rate
0 (default) | numeric | timetable

Risk free rate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RiskFreeRate' and a scalar
numeric or a one-column timetable.

Note If you specify a timetable:

•
The dates in the specified timetable must include the start and end dates of the backtest.

•
The series of dates in the specified timetable between the start and end dates (inclusive) must
correspond exactly to the corresponding series of dates in the assetPrices timetable.

If RatesConvention is "Annualized", then RiskFreeRate specifies an annualized rate.

If RatesConvention is "PerStep", then the RiskFreeRate is a decimal percentage and
represents the risk free rate for one time step in the backtest. For example, if the backtest uses daily
asset price data, then the RiskFreeRate value must be the daily rate of return for cash.

Data Types: double | timetable

CashBorrowRate — Cash borrowing rate
0 (default) | numeric | timetable

Cash borrowing rate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'CashBorrowRate' and a
scalar numeric or a one-column timetable.

Note If you specify a timetable:

•
The dates in the specified timetable must include the start and end dates of the backtest.

•
The series of dates in the specified timetable between the start and end dates (inclusive) must
correspond exactly to the corresponding series of dates in the assetPrices timetable.

The CashBorrowRate specifies the rate of interest accrual on negative cash balances (margin)
during the backtest.

If RatesConvention is "Annualized", then CashBorrowRate specifies an annualized rate.
