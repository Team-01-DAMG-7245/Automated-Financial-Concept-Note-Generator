Examples

Create a bm Object

Create a univariate Brownian motion (bm) object to represent the model: dXt = 0 . 3dWt.

obj = bm(0, 0.3) % (A = Mu, Sigma)

obj = 
   Class BM: Brownian Motion
   ----------------------------------------
     Dimensions: State = 1, Brownian = 1
   ----------------------------------------
      StartTime: 0
     StartState: 0
    Correlation: 1
          Drift: drift rate function F(t,X(t)) 
      Diffusion: diffusion rate function G(t,X(t)) 
     Simulation: simulation method/function simByEuler
             Mu: 0
          Sigma: 0.3

bm objects display the parameter A as the more familiar Mu.

The bm class also provides an overloaded Euler simulation method that improves run-time
performance in certain common situations. This specialized method is invoked automatically only if
all the following conditions are met:

•
The expected drift, or trend, rate Mu is a column vector.

•
The volatility rate, Sigma, is a matrix.

•
No end-of-period adjustments and/or processes are made.

•
If specified, the random noise process Z is a three-dimensional array.

•
If Z is unspecified, the assumed Gaussian correlation structure is a double matrix.
