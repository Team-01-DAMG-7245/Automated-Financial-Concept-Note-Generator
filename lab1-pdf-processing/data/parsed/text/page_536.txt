Rebalancing Period Actions for Efficient Portfolios

The action at each rebalancing period is to choose the weights of the investment portfolio for the next
time period. In this example assume that the possible portfolio weights are associated with the
portfolios on the efficient frontier. This example also assumes that the choice of possible portfolios is
fixed throughout the full investment period. However, weights are not required to be on the efficient
frontier. The only requirement is that the set of actions (portfolio choices) remains fixed throughout
the investment period.

To simplify the computations, define a finite subset of the efficient portfolios for possible actions.
Start by creating a Portfolio object with the asset information from
BlueChipStockMoments.mat.

p = Portfolio(AssetList=AssetList,AssetMean=AssetMean,...
    AssetCovar=AssetCovar);

Annualize the asset returns and the variance-covariance matrix.

p.AssetMean  = 12*p.AssetMean;
p.AssetCovar = 12*p.AssetCovar;

Use setBounds to add constraints to the portfolio problem. Here, assets do not represent more than
10% of the portfolio wealth and shorting is not allowed.

p = setBounds(p,0,0.1);

Use setBudget to specify that the portfolio must be fully invested.

p = setBudget(p,1,1);

Compute the weights of 15 portfolios on the efficient frontier using estimateFrontier. These
portfolios represent the possible actions at each rebalancing period.

nPortfolios = 15;
pwgt = estimateFrontier(p,nPortfolios);

Plot the efficient frontier using plotFrontier.

[prsk,pret] = plotFrontier(p,pwgt);
