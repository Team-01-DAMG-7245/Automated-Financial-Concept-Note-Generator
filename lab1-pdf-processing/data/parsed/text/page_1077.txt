Other improvised approaches are possible although most approaches are problem-dependent. In
particular, for mean and covariance estimation, the estimation function ecmnmle uses a function
ecmninit to obtain an initial estimate.

Nonrandom Residuals

Simultaneous estimates for parameters b and covariances C require C to be positive-definite. So, the
general multivariate normal regression routines require nondegenerate residual errors. If you are
faced with a model that has exact results, the least-squares routine ecmlsrmle still works, although
it provides a least-squares estimate with a singular residual covariance matrix. The other regression
functions fail.

Nonconvergence

Although the regression functions are robust and work for most “typical” cases, they can fail to
converge. The main failure mode is an ill-conditioned covariance matrix, where failures are either soft
or hard. A soft failure wanders endlessly toward a nearly singular covariance matrix and can be
spotted if the algorithm fails to converge after about 100 iterations. If MaxIterations is increased
to 500 and display mode is initiated (with no output arguments), a typical soft failure looks like this.

This case, which is based on 20 observations of five assets with 30% of data missing, shows that the
log-likelihood goes linearly to infinity as the likelihood function goes to 0. In this case, the function
converges but the covariance matrix is effectively singular with a smallest eigenvalue on the order of
machine precision (eps).

For the function ecmnmle, a hard error looks like this:

> In ecmninit at 60
  In ecmnmle at 140
