Simulation — A simulation function or method

Input Arguments

DriftRate — DriftRate is a user-defined drift-rate function and represents the parameter
F
vector or object of class drift

DriftRate is a user-defined drift-rate function and represents the parameter F, specified as a vector
or object of class drift.

DriftRate is a function that returns an NVars-by-1 drift-rate vector when called with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Alternatively, DriftRate can also be an object of class drift that encapsulates the drift-rate
specification. In this case, however, sde uses only the Rate parameter of the object. For more
information on the drift object, see drift.

Data Types: double | object

DiffusionRate — DiffusionRate is a user-defined diffusion-rate function and represents
the parameter G
matrix or object of class diffusion

DiffusionRate is a user-defined diffusion-rate function and represents the parameter G, specified
as a matrix or object of class diffusion.

DiffusionRate is a function that returns an NVars-by-NBROWNS diffusion-rate matrix when called
with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Alternatively, DiffusionRate can also be an object of class diffusion that encapsulates the
diffusion-rate specification. In this case, however, sde uses only the Rate parameter of the object.
For more information on the diffusion object, see diffusion.
