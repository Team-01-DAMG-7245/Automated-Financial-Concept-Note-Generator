The third row contains second-order lower partial moments of the three series. The square root of
these quantities provides an idea of the dispersion of returns that fall below the MAR. The market
index has a much larger variation on the downside when compared to the fund.

Expected Lower Partial Moments

This example shows how to use elpm to compute expected lower partial moments based on the mean
and standard deviations of normally distributed asset returns. The elpm function works with the
mean and standard deviations for multiple assets and multiple orders.

load FundMarketCash
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
MAR = mean(Returns(:,3))

MAR = 
0.0017

Mean = mean(Returns)

Mean = 1×3

0.0038    0.0030    0.0017

Sigma = std(Returns, 1)

Sigma = 1×3

0.0229    0.0389    0.0009

Assets

Assets = 1×3 cell
    {'Fund'}    {'Market'}    {'Cash'}

ELPM = elpm(Mean, Sigma, MAR, [0 1 2])

ELPM = 3×3

0.4647    0.4874    0.5000
    0.0082    0.0149    0.0004
    0.0002    0.0007    0.0000

Based on the moments of each asset, the expected values for lower partial moments imply better than
expected performance for the fund and market and worse than expected performance for cash. This
function works with either degenerate or nondegenerate normal random variables. For example, if
cash were truly riskless, its standard deviation would be 0. You can examine the difference in average
shortfall.

RisklessCash = elpm(Mean(3), 0, MAR, 1)

RisklessCash = 
0
