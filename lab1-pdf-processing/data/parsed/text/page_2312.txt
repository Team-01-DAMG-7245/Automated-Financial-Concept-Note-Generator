Object for portfolio, specified using a Portfolio object. For more information on creating a portfolio
object, see Portfolio.

Data Types: object

pwgt — Collection of portfolios
matrix

Collection of portfolios, specified as a NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix where NumAssets is the
number of assets in the universe and NumPorts is the number of portfolios in the collection of
portfolios.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

prsk — Estimates for standard deviations of portfolio returns for each portfolio in pwgt
vector

Estimates for standard deviations of portfolio returns for each portfolio in pwgt, returned as a
NumPorts vector.

prsk is returned for a Portfolio input object (obj). If the asset returns provided to the Portfolio
object are daily returns, then the output (prsk) for the standard deviation of the portfolio(s) is also in
daily terms.

pret — Estimates for means of portfolio returns for each portfolio in pwgt
vector

Estimates for means of portfolio returns for each portfolio in pwgt, returned as a NumPorts vector.

pret is returned for a Portfolio input object (obj). If the asset returns provided to the Portfolio
object are daily returns, then the output (pret) for returns is also in daily terms.

Moments of Portfolio Returns

The moments of portfolio returns are statistical measures that provide insights into the
characteristics of the return distribution of an investment portfolio.

The moments of portfolio returns provide information on:

•
The variance and standard deviation to help investors gauge the risk associated with their
portfolio.

•
A mean return that provides a benchmark for evaluating portfolio performance.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to estimate the moments of portfolio returns.

[prsk, pret] = obj.estimatePortMoments(pwgt);
