performance between the portfolio and benchmark is measured by a ratio based on the portfolio and
benchmark returns.

The optimized linking algorithm by Menchero [3] extends the single-period arithmetic performance
attribution to multiple periods by introducing the optimized linking coefficient βt for each period
before adding the single-period attributions. This step overcomes the fact that each single-period
attribution does not simply add over multiple periods, because the optimized linking coefficient βt
reconciles the difference that arises between simple arithmetic addition and geometric compounding.
As a result, the single-period Brinson model can be extended to multiple periods by using the
following optimized linking algorithm:

rυ = rp −rB = ∑
t = 1

T
βt(rP, t −rB, t) = ∑
j = 1

where

rp — Portfolio return over multiple periods

rB — Benchmark return over multiple periods

rυ — Value-added return over multiple periods

rP,t — Portfolio return for period t

rB,t — Benchmark return for period t

βt — Optimized linking coefficient for period t

T — Number of periods

N — Number of sectors

Sj,t — Sector allocation effect for sector j and period t

Uj,t — Allocation and selection interaction effect for sector j and period t

Ij,t — Issue selection effect for sector j and period t

Sj,t — Sector allocation effect for sector j over multiple periods

Uj,t — Allocation and sector interaction effect for sector j over multiple periods

Ij,t — Issue sector effect for sector j over multiple periods

In Menchero's optimized linking algorithm shown above, the optimized linking coefficient βt is
computed for each period using rP, rB, rP,t, rB,t, and T. This algorithm allows extending the Brinson
