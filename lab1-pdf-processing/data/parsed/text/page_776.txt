As the maturity increases, the variance of the returns increases and the distribution gets positively
skewed.

Solve CVaR Bond Portfolio Optimization

Now use the simulated returns (simMonthlyReturns) to solve conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
optimization problems of fixed-income portfolios.

To solve the CVaR problem, use the PortfolioCVaR object. The optimal portfolio must invest in at
least 10 types of bonds and no more than 30. At least 5% of the portfolio value must be invested in
any chosen bond. This example also requires that you invest the entire capital in the portfolio.

% 95% CVaR Portfolio
p = PortfolioCVaR(Scenarios=simMonthlyReturns,ProbabilityLevel=0.95);

% Semi-continuous bounds
p = setBounds(p,0.05,0.5,BoundType="conditional");

% Cardinality constraint
p = setMinMaxNumAssets(p,10,30);

% Fully-invested portfolio
p = setBudget(p,1,1);

Use setInequality to add a constraint to the portfolio duration to match a given benchmark
portfolio duration.

% Duration constraint
targetDuration = 10;
durationTol = 1;
bondsDuration = bnddurp(bondsPrices,couponRate,settle,bondsMaturity);
p = setInequality(p,[bondsDuration';-bondsDuration'], ...
    [targetDuration+durationTol;durationTol-targetDuration]);
