Continuously compounded or geometric covariance of asset returns, specified as an n-by-n
symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix. If Cg is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use
nearcorr to create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

Data Types: double

t — Target period of arithmetic moments in terms of periodicity of geometric moments
1 (default) | scalar positive numeric

(Optional) Target period of geometric moments in terms of periodicity of arithmetic moments,
specified as a scalar positive numeric.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

ma — Arithmetic mean of asset returns over the target period
vector

Arithmetic mean of asset returns over the target period (t), returned as an n-vector.

Ca — Arithmetic covariance of asset returns over the target period
matrix

Arithmetic covariance of asset returns over the target period (t), returned as an n-by-n matrix.

Algorithms

Geometric returns over period tG are modeled as multivariate lognormal random variables with
moments

E[Y] = 1 + mG

and

cov(Y) = CG

Arithmetic returns over period tA are modeled as multivariate normal random variables with moments

E[X] = mA

cov(X) = CA

Given t = tA / tG, the transformation from geometric to arithmetic moments is

CAi j = tlog 1 +

CGi j
(1 + mGi)(1 + mGj)

mAi = tlog(1 + mGi) −1
2CAii

For i,j = 1,..., n.

Note If t = 1, then X = log(Y).
