not necessary to reset the random number generator to simulate scenarios.

Obtain Portfolios with Targeted Portfolio Risks for a PortfolioMAD Object

To obtain efficient portfolios that have targeted portfolio risks, the estimateFrontierByRisk
function accepts one or more target portfolio risks and obtains efficient portfolios with the specified
risks. Assume you have a universe of four assets where you want to obtain efficient portfolios with
target portfolio risks of 12%, 20%, and 25%. This example uses the default 'direct' method to
estimate the optimal portfolios with targeted portfolio risks.

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = simulateNormalScenariosByMoments(p, m, C, 2000);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

pwgt = estimateFrontierByRisk(p, [0.12, 0.20, 0.25]);
