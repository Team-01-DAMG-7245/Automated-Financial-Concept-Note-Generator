Examine these two figures. There is a strong similarity between the miniature histograms on the
corresponding axes of each figure. This similarity is not coincidental.

Both copulas simulate uniform random variables, which are then transformed to daily centered
returns by the inverse CDF of the piecewise distribution of each index. Therefore, the simulated
returns of any given index are identically distributed regardless of the copula.

However, the scatter graph of each figure indicates the dependence structure associated with the
given copula, and in contrast to the univariate margins shown in the histograms, the scatter graphs
are distinct.

Once again, the copula defines a dependence structure regardless of its margins, and therefore offers
many features not limited to calibration alone.

For reference, simulate and plot centered returns using the Gaussian distribution, which underlies
the traditional Brownian motion model.
