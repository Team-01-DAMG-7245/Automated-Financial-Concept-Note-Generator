Diversify Portfolios Using Custom Objective

This example shows three techniques of asset diversification in a portfolio using the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function with a Portfolio object. The purpose of asset
diversification is to balance the exposure of the portfolio to any given asset to reduce volatility over a
period of time. Given the sensitivity of the minimum variance portfolio to the estimation of the
covariance matrix, some practitioners have added diversification techniques to the portfolio selection
with the hope of minimizing risk measures other than the variance measures such as turnover,
maximum drawdown, and so on.

This example applies these common diversification techniques:

•
Equally weighted (EW) portfolio on page 4-333

•
Equal risk contribution (ERC) on page 4-336

•
Most diversified portfolio (MDP) on page 4-334

Additionally, this example demonstrates penalty methods that you can use to achieve different
degrees of diversification. In those methods, you add a penalty term to the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function to balance the level of variance reduction and the
diversification of the portfolio.

Retrieve Market Data and Define Mean-Variance Portfolio

Begin by loading and computing the expected returns and their covariance matrix.

% Load data
load('port5.mat');
% Store the returns and covariance.
mu = mean_return;
Sigma = Correlation .* (stdDev_return * stdDev_return');

Define a mean-variance portfolio using a Portfolio object with default constraints to create a fully
invested, long-only portfolio.

% Create a mean-variance Portfolio object with default constraints.
p = Portfolio('AssetMean',mu,'AssetCovar',Sigma);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

One of the many features of the Portfolio object is that it can obtain the efficient frontier of the
portfolio problem. The efficient frontier is computed by solving a series of optimization problems for
which the return level of the portfolio, μ0, is modified to obtain different points on the efficient
frontier. These problems are defined as

min xTΣx

st .
∑
i = 1

n
xi = 1

xTμ ≥μ0
x ≥0

The advantage of using the Portfolio object to compute the efficient frontier is that you can obtain
without having to manually formulate and solve the multiple optimization problems shown above.
