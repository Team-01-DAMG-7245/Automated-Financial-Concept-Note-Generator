Inequality Constraint

An inequality constraint specifies a range of acceptable values rather than requiring an exact value.

Use inequality constraints to impose limits on certain parameters of the portfolio to ensure that the
portfolio adheres to specific guidelines or preferences set by the investor or portfolio manager.

Tips

•
You can also use dot notation to add the linear inequality constraints for portfolio weights.

obj = obj.addInequality(AInequality, bInequality)

•
You can also remove linear inequality constraints from any of the portfolio objects using dot
notation.

obj = obj.setInequality([ ], [ ])
