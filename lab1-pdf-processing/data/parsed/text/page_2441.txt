Input Arguments

Data — Data for a series of prices
matrix | table | timetable

Data for a series of prices, specified as a matrix, table, or timetable. Timetables and tables with M
rows must contain a variable named 'Price' (case insensitive).

Data Types: double | table | timetable

ax — Valid axis object
current axes (ax = gca) (default) | axes object

(Optional) Valid axis object, specified as an axes object. The kagi plot is created in the axes specified
by ax instead of in the current axes (ax = gca). The option ax can precede any of the input
argument combinations.

Data Types: object

h — Graphic handle of the figure

Kagi Chart

A Kagi chart represents price movements of an asset over time, focusing on the direction of price
rather than the time intervals.

Kagi charts consist of a series of vertical lines that change direction based on price movements. The
lines are drawn based on price changes and not on time intervals. The chart starts with a vertical line
that represents the initial price level. If the price rises by a specified amount (called the "reversal
amount"), a new line is drawn in the upward direction. Conversely, if the price falls by the same
reversal amount, a line is drawn downward. The reversal amount is a key parameter in Kagi charts. It
determines how much the price must change before a new line is drawn. This helps filter out minor
price fluctuations and focuses on significant price movements.
