ecmnstd

Standard errors for mean and covariance of incomplete data

Syntax

[StdMean,StdCovar] = ecmnstd(Data,Mean,Covariance)
[StdMean,StdCovar] = ecmnstd( ___ ,Method)

Description

[StdMean,StdCovar] = ecmnstd(Data,Mean,Covariance) computes standard errors for mean
and covariance of incomplete data.

Use ecmnstd after estimating the mean and covariance of Data with ecmnmle. If the mean and
distinct covariance elements are treated as the parameter θ in a complete-data maximum-likelihood
estimation, then as the number of samples increases, θ attains asymptotic normality such that

θ −E θ ∼N 0, I−1 θ ,

where E[θ] is the mean and I(θ) is the Fisher information matrix.

With missing data, the Hessian H(θ) is a good approximation for the Fisher information (which can
only be approximated when data is missing).

[StdMean,StdCovar] = ecmnstd( ___ ,Method) adds an optional argument for Method.

Examples

Compute Standard Errors for Mean and Covariance of Incomplete Data

This example shows how to compute the standard errors for mean and covariance of incomplete data
for five years of daily total return data for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and six
software companies

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

[ECMMean, ECMCovar] = ecmnmle(Data)
