Extreme Value Theory & Piecewise Probability Distributions

To prepare for copula modeling, characterize individually the distribution of returns of each index.
Although the distribution of each return series may be characterized parametrically, it is useful to fit
a semi-parametric model using a piecewise distribution with generalized Pareto tails. This uses
Extreme Value Theory to better characterize the behavior in each tail.

The Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™ software currently supports two univariate probability
distributions related to EVT, a statistical tool for modeling the fat-tailed behavior of financial data
such as asset returns and insurance losses:

•
Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, which uses a modeling technique known as the
block maxima or minima method. This approach divides a historical dataset into a set of sub-
intervals, or blocks, and the largest or smallest observation in each block is recorded and fitted to
a GEV distribution.

•
Generalized Pareto (GP) distribution, uses a modeling technique known as the distribution of
exceedances or peaks over threshold method. This approach sorts a historical dataset and fits the
amount by which those observations that exceed a specified threshold to a GP distribution.

The following analysis highlights the Pareto distribution, which is more widely used in risk
management applications.

Suppose we want to create a complete statistical description of the probability distribution of daily
asset returns of any one of the equity indices. Assume that this description is provided by a piecewise
semi-parametric distribution, where the asymptotic behavior in each tail is characterized by a
generalized Pareto distribution.
