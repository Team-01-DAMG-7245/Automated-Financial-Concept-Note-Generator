bm

Brownian motion (BM) models

Description

Creates and displays a Brownian motion (sometimes called arithmetic Brownian motion or
generalized Wiener process) bm object that derives from the sdeld (SDE with drift rate expressed in
linear form) class.

Use bm objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables driven by NBrowns sources of risk
over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time Brownian motion
stochastic processes. This enables you to transform a vector of NBrowns uncorrelated, zero-drift,
unit-variance rate Brownian components into a vector of NVars Brownian components with arbitrary
drift, variance rate, and correlation structure.

Use bm to simulate any vector-valued BM process of the form:

dXt = μ(t)dt + V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
μ is an NVars-by-1 drift-rate vector.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 vector of (possibly) correlated zero-drift/unit-variance rate Brownian
components.

Creation

Syntax

BM = bm(Mu,Sigma)
BM = bm( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

BM = bm(Mu,Sigma) creates a default BM object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.

•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.
