Specify Views of the Market

The views represent the subjective views of the investment analyst regarding future market changes,
expressed as q = P * μ + ε, ε N 0, Ω , Ω = diag ω1, ω2, . . . ωv , where v is total number of views.
For more information, see the Appendix section Assumptions and Views on page 4-227. With v views
and k assets, P is a v-by-k matrix, q is a v-by-1 vector, and Ω is a v-by-v diagonal matrix (representing
the independent uncertainty in the views). The views do not necessarily need to be independent
among themselves and the structure of Ω can be chosen to account for investment analyst
uncertainties in the views [4 on page 4-229]. The smaller the ωi in Ω, the smaller the variance in the
distribution of the ith view, and the stronger or more certain the investor's ith view. This example
assumes three independent views.

1
AIG is going to have 5% annual return with uncertainty 1e-3. This is a weak absolute view due to
its high uncertainty.

2
WMT is going to have 3% annual return with uncertainty 1e-3. This is a weak absolute view due
to its high uncertainty.

3
MSFT is going to outperform IBM by 5% annual return with uncertainty 1e-5. This is a strong
relative view due to its low uncertainty.

v = 3;  % total 3 views
P = zeros(v, numAssets);
q = zeros(v, 1);
Omega = zeros(v);

% View 1
P(1, assetNames=="AIG") = 1; 
q(1) = 0.05;
Omega(1, 1) = 1e-3;

% View 2
P(2, assetNames=="WMT") = 1; 
q(2) = 0.03;
Omega(2, 2) = 1e-3;

% View 3
P(3, assetNames=="MSFT") = 1; 
P(3, assetNames=="IBM") = -1; 
q(3) = 0.05;
Omega(3, 3) = 1e-5;
