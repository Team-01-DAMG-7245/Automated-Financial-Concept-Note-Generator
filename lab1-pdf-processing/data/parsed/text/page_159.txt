Linear Constraint Equations

This example shows how to use the Portfolio object to specify the minimum and maximum
investment in various groups.

While the Portfolio object allows you to enter a fixed set of constraints related to minimum and
maximum values for groups and individual assets, you often need to specify a larger and more
general set of constraints when finding the optimal risky portfolio. Portfolio also addresses this need,
by accepting an arbitrary set of constraints.

Maximum and Minimum Group Exposure

Group
Minimum Exposure
Maximum Exposure

North America
0.30
0.75

Europe
0.10
0.55

Latin America
0.20
0.50

Asia
0.50
0.50

The minimum and maximum exposure in Asia is the same. This means that you require a fixed
exposure for this group.

Also assume that the portfolio consists of three different funds. The correspondence between funds
and groups is shown in the table below.

Group Membership

Fund 1
Fund 2

Using the information in these two tables, build a mathematical representation of the constraints
represented. Assume that the vector of weights representing the exposure of each asset in a portfolio
is called Wts = [W1 W2 W3].

Specifically

1.
W1 + W2
≥
0.30

2.
W1 + W2
≤
0.75

3.
W3
≥
0.10

4.
W3
≤
0.55

5.
W1
≥
0.20

6.
W1
≤
0.50

7.
W2 + W3
=
0.50
