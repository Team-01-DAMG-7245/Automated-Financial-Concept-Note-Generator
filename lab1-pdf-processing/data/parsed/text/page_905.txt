Using the Sharpe Ratio

This example shows how to use the Sharpe ratio to calculate the ratio of an asset's excess return
divided by the asset's standard deviation of returns.

The Sharpe ratio is the ratio of the excess return of an asset divided by the asset's standard deviation
of returns. The Sharpe ratio has the form:

(Mean − Riskless) / Sigma

Here Mean is the mean of asset returns, Riskless is the return of a riskless asset, and Sigma is the
standard deviation of asset returns. A higher Sharpe ratio is better than a lower Sharpe ratio. A
negative Sharpe ratio indicates "anti-skill" since the performance of the riskless asset is superior. For
more information, see sharpe.

To compute the Sharpe ratio, the mean return of the cash asset is used as the return for the riskless
asset. Thus, given asset return data and the riskless asset return, the Sharpe ratio is calculated with

load FundMarketCash 
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
Riskless = mean(Returns(:,3))

Riskless = 
0.0017

Sharpe = sharpe(Returns, Riskless)

Sharpe = 1×3

0.0886    0.0315         0

The Sharpe ratio of the example fund is significantly higher than the Sharpe ratio of the market. As is
demonstrated with portalpha, this translates into a strong risk-adjusted return. Since the Cash
asset is the same as Riskless, it makes sense that its Sharpe ratio is 0. The Sharpe ratio was
calculated with the mean of cash returns. It can also be calculated with the cash return series as
input for the riskless asset

Sharpe = sharpe(Returns, Returns(:,3))

Sharpe = 1×3

0.0886    0.0315         0

When using the Portfolio object, you can use the estimateMaxSharpeRatio function to estimate
an efficient portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. For more information, see “Efficient Portfolio
That Maximizes Sharpe Ratio” on page 4-111.
