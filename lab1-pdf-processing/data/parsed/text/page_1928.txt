BusinessDayConvention — Business day conventions
'actual' (default) | character vector

Business day conventions, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BusinessDayConvention' and a character vector. The selection for business day convention
determines how non-business days are treated. Non-business days are defined as weekends plus any

following business day.

•
'modifiedfollow' — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed
on the following business day. However if the following business day is in a different month, the
previous business day is adopted instead.

•
'previous' — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed on the
previous business day.
