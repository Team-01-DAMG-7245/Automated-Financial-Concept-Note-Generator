Technical Indicators

Technical analysis (or charting) is used by some investment managers to help manage portfolios.
Technical analysis relies heavily on the availability of historical data. Investment managers calculate
different indicators from available data and plot them as charts. Observations of price, direction, and
volume on the charts assist managers in making decisions on their investment portfolios.

The technical analysis functions in Financial Toolbox are tools to help analyze your investments. The
functions in themselves will not make any suggestions or perform any qualitative analysis of your
investment.
