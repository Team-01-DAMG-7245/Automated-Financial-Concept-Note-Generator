The associated hazard rates are returned as an optional output. The convention is that the first
hazard rate applies from the settlement date to the first market date, the second hazard rate from the
first to the second market date, and so on, and the last hazard rate applies from the second-to-last
market date onwards. The following plot displays the bootstrapped hazard rates, plotted against time,
in years, from the valuation date:

HazTimes = yearfrac(Settle,HazData(:,1));
figure
stairs([0; HazTimes(1:end-1,1); HazTimes(end,1)+1], ...
[HazData(:,2);HazData(end,2)])
grid on
axis([0 HazTimes(end,1)+1 0.9*HazData(1,2) 1.1*HazData(end,2)])
xlabel('Time (Years)')
ylabel('Hazard Rate')
