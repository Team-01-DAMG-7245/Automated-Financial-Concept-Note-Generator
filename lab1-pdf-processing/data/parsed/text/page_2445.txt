outputType — Year to determine days
'datenum' (default) | character vector with values 'datenum' or 'datetime'

A character vector specified as either 'datenum' or 'datetime'. The output Date is in serial date
format if 'datenum' is specified, or datetime format if 'datetime' is specified. By default the
output Date is in serial date format, or match the format of Holiday, if specified.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

Date — Date for the last business date of given year and month
datetime | serial date number

Date for the last business date of a given year and month, returned as a datetime or serial date
number.

If neither Holiday nor outputType are specified, Date is returned as a serial date number. If
Holiday is specified, but not outputType, then the type of the holiday variable controls the type of
date:

•
If Holiday is a string or date character vector, then Date is returned as a serial date number. Use
the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

•
If Holiday is a datetime array, then Date is returned as a datetime array.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although lbusdate supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
