covarianceDenoising computes a covariance estimate from a data sample or from an initial
covariance estimate (usually the standard covariance estimate from cov). The
covarianceDenoising function reduces the noise in the estimator generated from using a finite
sample. Unlike covarianceShrinkage, the covarianceDenoising function differentiates
between the noise and the signal in the data to pull only the eigenvalues associated with noise
towards a target value. This technique results in an estimate that decreases noise while increasing
the signal.
