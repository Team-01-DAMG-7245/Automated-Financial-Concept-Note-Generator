Info.Obj – A variable-extent column vector, with no more than MaxIterations elements, that
contain each value of the objective function at each iteration of the estimation algorithm. The last
value in this vector, Obj(end), is the terminal estimate of the objective function. If you do
maximum likelihood estimation, the objective function is the log-likelihood function.
