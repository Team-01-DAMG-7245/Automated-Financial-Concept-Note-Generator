When none of the constraints from 'BoundType', 'MinNumAssets', or 'MaxNumAssets' are
active, the redundant constraints from 'BoundType', 'MinNumAssets', 'MaxNumAssets' warning
occurs. This happens when you explicitly use setBounds and setMinMaxNumAssets but with values
that are inactive. That is, the 'Conditional' BoundType has a LowerBound = [ ] or 0,
'MinNumAssets' is 0, or 'MaxNumAssets' is the same value as NumAssets. In other words, if any
of these three are active, the warning will not show up when using the estimate functions or
plotFrontier. The following two examples show the rationale.
