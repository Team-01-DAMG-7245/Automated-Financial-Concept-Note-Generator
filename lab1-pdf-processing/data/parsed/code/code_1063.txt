To estimate stock betas for all twelve stocks, set up a joint regression model that groups all twelve
stocks within a single design (since each stock has the same design matrix, this model is actually an
example of seemingly-unrelated regression). The function to estimate model parameters is
ecmmvnrmle and the function to estimate standard errors is ecmmvnrstd.
