Use bootstrp with transprobbytotals as the bootstrap function and idTotals as the data to
sample from. Each bootstrap sample corresponds to a dataset made of companies sampled with
replacement from the original data. However, you do not have to draw companies from the original
data, because a bootstrap idTotals sample contains all the information required to compute the
transition probabilities. transprobbytotals aggregates all structures in each bootstrap idTotals
sample and finds the corresponding transition matrix.
