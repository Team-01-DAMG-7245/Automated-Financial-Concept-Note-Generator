Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as an NBrowns-by-NBrowns positive semidefinite matrix, or as a
deterministic function C(t) that accepts the current time t and returns an NBrowns-by-NBrowns
positive semidefinite correlation matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite
matrix, use nearcorr to create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.
