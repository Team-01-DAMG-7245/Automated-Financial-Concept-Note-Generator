Use simBySolution to simulate NTrials sample paths of NVARS correlated state variables driven
by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk and NJumps compound Poisson processes representing
the arrivals of important events over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The function
approximates continuous-time Merton jump diffusion process by an approximation of the closed-form
solution.
