Given a CVaR portfolio set specified in a PortfolioCVaR object, you often want to check if specific
portfolios are feasible with respect to the portfolio set. This can occur with, for example, initial
portfolios and with portfolios obtained from other procedures. The checkFeasibility function
determines whether a collection of portfolios is feasible. Suppose that you perform the following
portfolio optimization and want to determine if the resultant efficient portfolios are feasible relative
to a modified problem.
