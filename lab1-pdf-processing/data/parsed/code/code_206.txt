In many applications, creating a new optimal portfolio requires comparing the new portfolio with an
initial or current portfolio to form lists of purchases and sales. The Portfolio object property
InitPort lets you identify an initial or current portfolio. The initial portfolio also plays an essential
role if you have either transaction costs or turnover constraints. The initial portfolio need not be
feasible within the constraints of the problem. This can happen if the weights in a portfolio have
shifted such that some constraints become violated. To check if your initial portfolio is feasible, use
the checkFeasibility function described in “Validating Portfolios” on page 4-95. Suppose that
you have an initial portfolio in x0, then use the Portfolio object to set up an initial portfolio:
