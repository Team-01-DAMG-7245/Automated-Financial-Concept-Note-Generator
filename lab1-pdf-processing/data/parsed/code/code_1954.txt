The rebalance function (“rebalanceFcn” on page 15-0
) is the user-authored function that contains
the logic of the strategy. The backtesting engine calls the strategy rebalance function with a fixed set
of parameters and expects it to return a vector of asset weights representing the new, desired
portfolio allocation after a rebalance. For more information, see the rebalance functions on page 15-
247.
