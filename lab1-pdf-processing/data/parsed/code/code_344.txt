In addition to transaction costs, the Portfolio object can handle turnover constraints. The following
example demonstrates that a turnover constraint produces an efficient frontier in the neighborhood
of an initial portfolio that may restrict trading. Moreover, the introduction of a turnover constraint
often implies that multiple trades may be necessary to shift from an initial portfolio to an
unconstrained efficient frontier. Consequently, the turnover constraint introduces a form of time
diversification that can spread trades out over multiple time periods. In this example, note that the
sum of purchases and sales from the estimateFrontier function confirms that the turnover
constraint is satisfied.
