To visualize the timetable data, use financial charting functions such as highlow or movavg. For this
example, the moving average information is plotted on the same chart for highlow to provide a
complete visualization. To obtain the stock performance in 2014, use the MATLAB timerange
function to select rows of the timetable. To visualize a technical indicator such as the Moving
Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), pass the timetable object into the macd function for
analysis.
