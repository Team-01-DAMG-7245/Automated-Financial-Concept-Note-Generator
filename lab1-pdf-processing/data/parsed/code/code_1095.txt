Evaluate and plot the efficient frontier at 20 points along the frontier, using the function portopt
and the expected returns and corresponding covariance matrix. Although rather elaborate constraints
can be placed on the assets in a portfolio, for simplicity accept the default constraints and scale the
total value of the portfolio to 1 and constrain the weights to be positive (no short-selling).
