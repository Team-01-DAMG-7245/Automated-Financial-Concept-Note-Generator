To determine cash-flow dates for securities with periodic payments, use cfdates. This function
accounts for the coupons per year, the day-count basis, and the end-of-month rule. For example, you
can determine the cash-flow dates for a security that pays four coupons per year on the last day of
the month using an actual/365 day-count basis. To do so, enter the settlement date, the maturity
date, and the parameters for Period, Basis, and EndMonthRule.
