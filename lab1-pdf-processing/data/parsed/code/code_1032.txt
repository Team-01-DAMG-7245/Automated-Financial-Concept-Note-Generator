In Financial Toolbox software, both the changes in the log-likelihood function and the norm of the
change in parameter estimates are monitored. Whenever both changes fall below specified tolerances
(which should be something between machine precision and its square root), the toolbox functions
terminate under an assumption that convergence has been achieved.
