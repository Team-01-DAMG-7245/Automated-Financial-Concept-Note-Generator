To obtain efficient portfolios that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, the estimateMaxSharpeRatio
function accepts a Portfolio object and obtains efficient portfolios that maximize the Sharpe Ratio.
Suppose that you have a universe with four risky assets and a riskless asset and you want to obtain a
portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, where, in this example, r0 is the return for the riskless
asset.
