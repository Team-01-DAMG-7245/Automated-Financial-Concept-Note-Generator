To obtain the long-only fully invested risk parity portfolio, use the riskBudgetingPortfolio
function. When you pass a returns covariance matrix to riskBudgetingPortfolio, the function
computes the associated risk parity portfolio. To compute the initial weights for the risk parity
strategy, riskBudgetingPortfolio uses the covariance matrix estimated with information from
the first two months.
