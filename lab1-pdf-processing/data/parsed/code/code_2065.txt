Dependent random counting process for generating the number of jumps, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'N' and a function or an (NPeriods â¨‰ NSteps) -by-NJumps-by-
NNTrials three-dimensional array of dependent random variates. If you specify a function, N must
return an NJumps-by-1 column vector, and you must call it with two inputs: a real-valued scalar
observation time t followed by an NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.
