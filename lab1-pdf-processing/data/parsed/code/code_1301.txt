This example shows the effect of the sample size in covarianceDenoising to compute a denoised
version of an initial covariance estimate. The covarianceDenoising function has two different
syntaxes. This example focuses on the syntax with two inputs: a covariance estimate and the size of
the sample that you use to compute the initial covariance estimate. This example demonstrates an
empirical study of the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the denoised estimate. The goal of
this example is to provide insight for the choice of the sample size when this information is not
available. This scenario can happen if the initial covariance estimate is stored but the information of
the sample used to compute the estimate is not available.
