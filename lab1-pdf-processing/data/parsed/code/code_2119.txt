When you specify parameters as functions, they must evaluate properly when passed a scalar, real-
valued sample time (t), and an NVars-by-1 state vector (Xt). They must also generate an array of
appropriate dimensions, which in the first case is a scalar constant, and in the second case is a scalar,
piecewise constant function of time alone. You are not required to use either time (t) or state (Xt). In
the current example, the function evaluates properly when passed time followed by state, thereby
satisfying the minimal requirements. The fact that it also evaluates correctly when passed only time
simply indicates that the function does not require the state vector Xt. The important point to make is
that it works when you pass it t, Xt .
