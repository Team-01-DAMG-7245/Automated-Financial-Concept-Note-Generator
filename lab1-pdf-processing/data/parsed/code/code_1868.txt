The Brownian semistationary process (Yt in the general rough volatility model) is a two-sided
Brownian motion (W) providing the fundamental noise innovations, with an amplitude that is
modulated by a stochastic volatility process depending on W. This driving noise is then convolved
with a deterministic kernel function g that specifies the dependence structure of Yt. The process Yt is
also viewed as a moving average of volatility modulated Brownian noise. When you set the volatility
of volatility = 1, the stationary Brownian moving averages are nested in this class of processes.
