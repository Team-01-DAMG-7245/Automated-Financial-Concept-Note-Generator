The “RebalanceFrequency” on page 15-0
 property determines how often the backtesting engine
rebalances and reallocates the portfolio of a strategy using the rebalance function. Set the
RebalanceFrequency in terms of time steps in the backtest. For example, if the backtesting engine
is testing a strategy with a set of daily price data, then set the rebalance function in days. Essentially,
RebalanceFrequency represents the number of rows of price data to process between each call to
the strategy rebalance function.
