When you invoke drift-rate parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the impression
of dynamic behavior. The parameters A and B accept the observation time t and a state vector Xt, and
return an array of appropriate dimension. Specifically, parameters A and B evaluate the
corresponding drift-rate component. Even if you originally specified an input as an array, drift
treats it as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing that all parameters are
accessible by the same interface.
