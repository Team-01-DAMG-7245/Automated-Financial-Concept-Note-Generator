The goal of this example is to find portfolios that are efficient in the sense that they minimize the
variance, maximize return, and maximize the average percentage of women on the board of directors.
To find the average percentage of women on a company's board (WoB) for a given portfolio, this
example uses a weighted sum of the percentages of WoB for each individual asset, where the weights
are given by the amount invested in each asset for the portfolio. By defining the average percentage
of WoB this way, the WoB function is linear with respect to the weights.
