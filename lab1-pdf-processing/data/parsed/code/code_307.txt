covarianceShrinkage computes a covariance estimate from a data sample. This function
reduces the noise in the estimator generated from using a finite sample. Shrinkage estimators are
used to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of an estimate. MSE consists of two parts, the bias
and the noise. Shrinkage methods reduce the noise in the estimator by pulling the standard
covariance estimate towards a target matrix. Thus, the shrinkage estimator results in a biased
estimate, but with a lower variance than that of the standard covariance estimate. The method
implemented in covarianceShrinkage considers a multiple of the identity as the target matrix.
