Define a custom myStepFunction function that describes the dynamics of the environment. This
includes how the state changes from a current state given the agent action and how the earned
reward is computed by such an action. For the reward, here you can choose either a sparse
reward function or a constant return reward function. At each training time step, the state of the
model is updated using the myStepFunction function. This function also determines when a
training episode finishes.
