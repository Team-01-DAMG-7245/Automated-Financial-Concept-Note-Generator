Create the return and volatility functions and the GBM model using gbm. Notice that the rate of
return is a deterministic function of time, and therefore accepts simulation time as its only input
argument. In contrast, the volatility must account for the moneyness and is a function of both time
and stock price. Moreover, since the volatility surface is defined as a function of time to maturity
rather than simulation time, the volatility function subtracts the current simulation time from the last
time at which the price process is simulated (10 years). This ensures that as the simulation time
approaches its terminal value, the time to maturity of the volatility surface approaches zero. Although
far more elaborate return and volatility functions could be used if desired, the following assumes
simple linear interpolation.
