The simBySolution function simulates the state vector Xt by an approximation of the closed-form
solution of diagonal drift Merton jump diffusion models. Specifically, it applies a Euler approach to
the transformed log[Xt] process (using Ito's formula). In general, this is not the exact solution to the
Merton jump diffusion model because the probability distributions of the simulated and true state
vectors are identical only for piecewise constant parameters.
