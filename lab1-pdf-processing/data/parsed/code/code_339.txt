This function is commonly used to construct risk parity portfolios. Although this function is
convex, problems with cardinality constraints or conditional bounds make this function ill-defined.
This happens because lnxi is not defined when xi = 0. Since adding cardinality constraints or
conditional bounds imply that some assets have a weight of 0, the function becomes ill-defined at
the points of interest.
