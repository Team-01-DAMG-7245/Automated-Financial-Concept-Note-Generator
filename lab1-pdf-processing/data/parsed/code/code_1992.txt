When running a backtest in MATLAB®, you need to understand what the initial conditions are when
the backtest begins. The initial weights for each strategy, the size of the strategy lookback window,
and any potential split of the dataset into training and testing partitions affects the results of the
backtest. This example shows how to use the runBacktest function with the 'Start' and 'End'
name-value pair arguments that interact with the “LookbackWindow” on page 15-0
 and
“RebalanceFrequency” on page 15-0
 properties of the backtestStrategy object to "warm start"
a backtest.
