The first univariate model is a GBM model with a stochastic volatility function and a stochastic jump
process, and usually corresponds to a price process whose variance rate is governed by the second
univariate model. The second model is a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) square root diffusion model that
describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled GBM price process.
