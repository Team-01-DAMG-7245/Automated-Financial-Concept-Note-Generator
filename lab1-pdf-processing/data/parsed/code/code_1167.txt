The only exception to the (t, Xt) evaluation interface is Correlation. Specifically, when you enter
Correlation as a function, the SDE engine assumes that it is a deterministic function of time, C t .
This restriction on Correlation as a deterministic function of time allows Cholesky factors to be
computed and stored before the formal simulation. This inconsistency dramatically improves run-time
performance for dynamic correlation structures. If Correlation is stochastic, you can also include it
within the simulation architecture as part of a more general random number generation function.
