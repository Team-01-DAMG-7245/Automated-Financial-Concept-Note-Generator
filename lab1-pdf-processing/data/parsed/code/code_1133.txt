Use the MATLABÂ® timetable function to create a timetable object. Alternatively, you can use the
MATLAB conversion function table2timetable to convert a table to a timetable. In this example,
the timetable TMW_TT is constructed from a table and is only for illustration purposes. After you
create a timetable object, you can use the Description field of the timetable object to store
meta-information about the timetable.
