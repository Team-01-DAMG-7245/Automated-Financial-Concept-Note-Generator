Note The ewstats function may give slightly different results from the RiskMetrics® approach for
determining expected return and covariance from a time series. This is because ewstats calculates
NumEffObs by directly summing the unnormalized weights, while RiskMetrics® uses an
approximation. Additionally, RiskMetrics® assumes a mean of 0 in the return series when calculating
the covariance, while ewstats uses the calculated ExpReturn output.
