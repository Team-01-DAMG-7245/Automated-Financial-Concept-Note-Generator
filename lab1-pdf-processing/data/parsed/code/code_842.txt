As a function of the portfolio weights, the MAD of the portfolio is a convex non-smooth function (see
Konno and Yamazaki [50] at “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5). The PortfolioMAD object
computes MAD as this nonlinear function which can be handled by the solver fmincon Optimization
Toolbox. The nonlinear programming solver fmincon has several algorithms that can be selected
with the setSolver function, the two algorithms that work best in practice are 'sqp' and
'active-set'.
