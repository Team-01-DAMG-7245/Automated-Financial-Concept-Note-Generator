Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as a scalar, a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite matrix, or as a deterministic
function Ct that accepts the current time t and returns an 2-by-2 positive semidefinite correlation
matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use nearcorr to create a
positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.
