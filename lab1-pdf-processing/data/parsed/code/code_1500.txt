In contrast, the simBySolution function provides a more accurate description of the underlying
model. This function simulates the price paths by an approximation of the closed-form solution of
separable models. Specifically, it applies a Euler approach to a transformed process, which in general
is not the exact solution to this GBM model. This is because the probability distributions of the
simulated and true state vectors are identical only for piecewise constant parameters.
