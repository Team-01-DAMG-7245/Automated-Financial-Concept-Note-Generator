This example specifies a noise function to stratify the terminal value of a univariate equity price
series. Starting from known initial conditions, the function first stratifies the terminal value of a
standard Brownian motion, and then samples the process from beginning to end by drawing
conditional Gaussian samples using a Brownian bridge.
