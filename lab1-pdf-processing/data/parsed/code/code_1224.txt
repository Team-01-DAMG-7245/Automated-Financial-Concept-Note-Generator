The stratification process assumes that each path is associated with a single stratified terminal value
such that the number of paths is equal to the number of strata. This technique is called proportional
sampling. This example is similar to, yet more sophisticated than, the one discussed in “Simulating
Interest Rates” on page 14-50. Since stratified sampling requires knowledge of the future, it also
requires more sophisticated time synchronization; specifically, the function in this example requires
knowledge of the entire sequence of sample times.
