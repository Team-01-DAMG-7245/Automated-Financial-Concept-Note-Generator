To clear a tracking portfolio from your Portfolio object, use either the Portfolio object or the
setTrackingPort function with an empty input for the TrackingPort property. If transaction
costs or turnover constraints are set, it is not possible to clear the TrackingPort property in this
way. In this case, to clear TrackingPort, first clear the dependent properties and then clear
theTrackingPort property.
