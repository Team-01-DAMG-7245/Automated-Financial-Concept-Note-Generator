MATLABÂ® supports a fillmissing function that you can use before creating a creditscorecard
object to treat missing values in numeric and categorical data. The advantage of this method is that
you can use all the options available in fillmissing to fill missing data, as well as other MATLAB
functionality, such as standardizeMissing and features for the treatment of outliers. However, the
downside is that you are responsible for the same transformations to the validation data before
scoring as the fillmissing function is outside of the creditscorecard object.
