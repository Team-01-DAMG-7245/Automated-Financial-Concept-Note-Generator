The initial weights are calculated by calling the backtestStrategy rebalance function in the same
way that the backtesting engine will call it. To do so, pass in a vector of current weights (all zeros,
that is 100% cash) as well as a window of price data that the strategies will use to set the desired
weights (the warm-up data partition). Using the rebalance functions to compute the initial weights in
this way is not required. The initial weights are a vector of the initial portfolio weights and can be set
to any appropriate value. The rebalance functions in this example approximate the state the
strategies would be in had they been already running at the start of the backtest.
