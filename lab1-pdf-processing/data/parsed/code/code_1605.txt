The interpolate function assumes that the user-specified time series array Paths is associated
with the sde object. For example, the Times and Paths input pair are the result of an initial
course-grained simulation. However, the interpolation ignores the initial conditions of the sde
object (StartTime and StartState), allowing the user-specified Times and Paths input series
to take precedence.
