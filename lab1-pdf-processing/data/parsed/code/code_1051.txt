This case, which is based on 20 observations of five assets with 30% of data missing, shows that the
log-likelihood goes linearly to infinity as the likelihood function goes to 0. In this case, the function
converges but the covariance matrix is effectively singular with a smallest eigenvalue on the order of
machine precision (eps).
