In the absence of any views, the equilibrium returns are likely equal to the implied returns from the
equilibrium portfolio holding. In practice, the applicable equilibrium portfolio holding can be any
optimal portfolio that the investment analyst would use in the absence of additional views on the
market, such as the portfolio benchmark, an index, or even the current portfolio [2 on page 4-229]. In
this example, you use linear regression to find a market portfolio that tracks the returns of the DJI
benchmark. Then, you use the market portfolio as the equilibrium portfolio and the equilibrium
returns are implied from the market portfolio. The findMarketPortfolioAndImpliedReturn
function, defined in Local Functions on page 4-226, implements the equilibrium returns. This function
takes historical asset returns and benchmark returns as inputs and outputs the market portfolio and
the corresponding implied returns.
