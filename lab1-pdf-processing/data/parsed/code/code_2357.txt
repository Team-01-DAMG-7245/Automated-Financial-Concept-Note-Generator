This example shows how to use estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio to define a risk-constrained
long-only, fully-invested portfolio and then compare the maximum return portfolio against a minimum
tracking error portfolio, where the tracking portfolio is the equally-weighted portfolio. You define the
constraints for portfolio problems using functions for the Portfolio object and then you specify the
objective function as an input to estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio. The objective function
must be continuous (and preferably smooth).
