It is useful to know what are the upper and lower limits of the portfolio moments along the efficient
frontier. This information allows you to determine what are feasible targets. Use the
estimateFrontierLimits function with the Portfolio object to identify the weights at these
extremes. Then you can use the estimatePortMoments function Portfolio object to find the
limiting moments.
