Each time the backtest engine calls a strategy rebalance function, a rolling window of asset price
data (and possibly signal data) is passed to the rebalance function. The rebalance function can then
make trading and allocation decisions based on that data. The “LookbackWindow” on page 15-0
property sets the size of these rolling windows in terms of time steps. The window determines the
amount of data from the asset price timetable that are passed to the rebalance function.
