The user-defined computeTransactionCostsFcn function handle takes a single input
argument, deltaPositions, which is a vector of changes in asset positions for all assets (in
currency units) as a result of a rebalance. Positive elements in the deltaPositions vector
indicate purchases while negative entries represent sales. The user-defined function handle
must return two output arguments buyCosts and sellCosts, which contain the total costs
(in currency) for the entire rebalance for each type of transaction.
