The convert2sur function converts a multivariate normal regression model into a seemingly
unrelated regression, or SUR, model. The second function ecmninit is a specialized function to
obtain initial ad hoc estimates for the mean and covariance of a Data matrix with missing data. (If
there are no missing values, the estimates are the maximum likelihood estimates for the mean and
covariance.)
