Both the Portfolio object and the setAssetMoments function perform scalar expansion on
arguments for the moments of asset returns. When using the Portfolio object, the number of
assets must be already specified in the variable NumAssets. If NumAssets has not already been set,
a scalar argument is interpreted as a scalar with NumAssets set to 1. setAssetMoments provides
an additional optional argument to specify the number of assets so that scalar expansion works with
the correct number of assets. In addition, if either a scalar or vector is input for the covariance of
asset returns, a diagonal matrix is formed such that a scalar expands along the diagonal and a vector
becomes the diagonal. This example demonstrates scalar expansion for four jointly independent
assets with a common mean 0.1 and common variance 0.03:
