The user-defined computeTransactionCostsFcn function handle takes a single input
argument, deltaPositions, which is a vector of changes in asset positions for all assets (in
currency units) as a result of a rebalance. Positive elements in the deltaPositions vector
indicate purchases while negative entries represent sales. The user-defined function handle
returns one output argument for detailedCosts for per-asset transaction costs.
