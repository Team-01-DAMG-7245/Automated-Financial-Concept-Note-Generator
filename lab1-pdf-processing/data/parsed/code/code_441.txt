Instead of requiring a specific level for the portfolio's average percentage of WoB, the goal is to find
the traditional mean-variance efficient frontiers while excluding assets that have a percentage of WoB
lower than a given threshold. You can plot the exclusion using the plotExclusionExample function
in Local Functions on page 4-269.
