To have a fully specified mean-variance portfolio optimization problem, you must specify the
mean and covariance of asset returns. Since starting with these moments in the variables
AssetMean and AssetCovar, you can use the setAssetMoments function to enter these
variables into your Portfolio object (remember that you are assuming that your raw data are
monthly returns which is why you divide your annual input moments by 12 to get monthly
returns).
