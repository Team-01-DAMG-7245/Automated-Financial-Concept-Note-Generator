Use transprobgrouptotals to group whole ratings into investment and speculative grades. This
function takes a totals structure as the first argument. The second argument indicates the edges
between rating categories. In this case, ratings 1 through 4 ('AAA' through 'BBB') correspond to
the first category ('IG'), ratings 5 through 7 ('BB' through 'CCC') to the second category ('SG'),
and rating 8 ('D') is a category of its own. transprobgrouptotals adds up the total time spent on
ratings that belong to the same category. For example, total times spent on 'AAA' through 'BBB' are
added up as the total time spent on 'IG'. transprobgrouptotals also adds up the total number of
transitions between any 'IG' rating and any 'SG' rating, for example, a credit migration from
'BBB' to 'BB'.
