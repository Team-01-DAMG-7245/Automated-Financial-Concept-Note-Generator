The PortfolioCVaR object implements conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) portfolio optimization. Every
property and function of the PortfolioCVaR object is public, although some properties and
functions are hidden. See PortfolioCVaR for the properties and functions of a PortfolioCVaR
object. The PortfolioCVaR object is a value object where every instance of the object is a distinct
version of the object. Since the PortfolioCVaR object is also a MATLAB object, it inherits the
default functions associated with MATLAB objects.
