When working with copulas, it is often convenient to allow the random number generator function
Z(t,X) to induce dependence (of which the traditional notion of linear correlation is a special case)
with the copula, and to induce magnitude or scale of variation (similar to volatility or standard
deviation) with the semi-parametric CDF and inverse CDF transforms. Since the CDF and inverse
CDF transforms of each index inherit the characteristics of historical returns, this also explains why
the returns are now centered.
