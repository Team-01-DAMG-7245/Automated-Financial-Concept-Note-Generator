The specification of the initial portfolio from Blotter gives the number of assets in your
universe so you do not need to specify the NumAssets property directly. Next, set up default
constraints (long-only with a budget constraint). In addition, set up the group constraint that
imposes an upper bound on equities in the portfolio (equities are identified in the group matrix
with 1's) and the upper bound constraint on emerging equities. Although you could have set the
upper bound on emerging equities using the setBounds function, notice how the addGroups
function is used to set up this constraint.
