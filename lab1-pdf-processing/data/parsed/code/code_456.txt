The strategies in Diversification for Fixed ESG Level on page 4-274 explicitly set a target ESG
average score. However, a different set of strategies controls the ESG score in a less direct way. The
method in these strategies uses ESG tilting. With tilting, you discretize the ESG score into 'high'
and 'low' levels and the objective function penalizes each level differently. In other words, you use
the diversification measure to tilt the portfolio toward higher or lower ESG values. Therefore, instead
of explicitly requiring that the portfolios maintain a target ESG average score, you select assets, with
respect to their ESG score, implicitly through the choice of penalty parameters.
