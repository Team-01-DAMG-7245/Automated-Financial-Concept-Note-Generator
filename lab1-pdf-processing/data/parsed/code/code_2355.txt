This example shows how to use estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio to compare the weight
assignment of the minimum risk portfolio with a constrained equally weighted portfolio. The weights
can be either zero or greater than 15% and must sum to 1. You define the constraints for portfolio
problems using functions for the Portfolio object and then you specify the objective function as an
input to estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio. The objective function must be continuous (and
preferably smooth).
