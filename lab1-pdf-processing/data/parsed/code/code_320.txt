The second example is when you explicitly set the three constraints, but all with inactive values. In
this example, the BoundType is 'Conditional' and the LowerBound is 0, thus specifying
ineffective 'Conditional' BoundType constraints, and the 'MinNumAssets' and
'MaxNumAssets' values are 0 and 3, respectively. The setMinMaxNumAssets function specifies
ineffective 'MinNumAssets' and 'MaxNumAssets' constraints.
