The MATLABÂ® backtesting engine runs backtests of portfolio investment strategies over time series
of asset price data. After creating a set of backtest strategies using backtestStrategy and the
backtesting engine using backtestEngine, the runBacktest function executes the backtest. After
using the runBacktest function to test investment strategies, you can run the equityCurve
function to plot the equity curves of strategies.
