The function covarianceDenoising computes the denoised estimate of the covariance matrix and
returns as a second output the number of eigenvalues identified with signal. You use this number in
the Optimize the Asset Allocation Using Factor Modeling on page 4-396 section to determine the
number of factors that the factor model allocation uses.
