To obtain efficient portfolios that have targeted portfolio risks, the estimateFrontierByRisk
function accepts one or more target portfolio risks and obtains efficient portfolios with the specified
risks. Assume you have a universe of four assets where you want to obtain efficient portfolios with
target portfolio risks of 12%, 14%, and 16%. This example uses the default 'direct' method to
estimate the optimal portfolios with targeted portfolio risks.
