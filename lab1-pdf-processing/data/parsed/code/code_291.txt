To modify either lcprog or to specify quadprog as your solver, use the setSolver function to set
the hidden properties solverType and solverOptions that specify and control the solver. Because
the solver properties are hidden, you cannot set these options using the Portfolio object. The
default solver is lcprog so you do not need to use setSolver to specify this solver. To use
quadprog, you can set the default interior-point-convex algorithm of quadprog using this
code:
