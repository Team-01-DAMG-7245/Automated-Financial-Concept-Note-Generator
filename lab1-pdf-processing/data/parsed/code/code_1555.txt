When you invoke these parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the impression of
dynamic behavior. The parameters accept the observation time t and a state vector Xt, and return an
array of appropriate dimension. Even if you originally specified an input as an array, heston treats it
as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing that all parameters are accessible
by the same interface.
