The output from the binomial function is a binary tree. Read the StockPrice matrix this way:
column 1 shows the price for period 0, column 2 shows the up and down prices for period 1, column 3
shows the up-up, up-down, and down-down prices for period 2, and so on. Ignore the zeros. The
OptionPrice matrix gives the associated option value for each node in the price tree. Ignore the
zeros that correspond to a zero in the price tree.
