An important step in portfolio optimization is to validate that the portfolio problem is feasible and the
main test is to ensure that the set of portfolios is nonempty and bounded. Use the estimateBounds
function to determine the bounds for the portfolio set. In this case, since both lb and ub are finite,
the set is bounded.
