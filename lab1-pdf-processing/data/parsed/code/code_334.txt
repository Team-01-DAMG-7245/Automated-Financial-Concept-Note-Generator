When using a Portfolio object and the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function with the
Financial Toolbox solvers, the solvers return a local minimum, which is not guaranteed to be a global
minimum. A local minimum of a function is a point where the function value is smaller than the points
around it, but the value is larger than a distant point. A global minimum is the point where the
function value is smaller than at all other points. Convex functions play an important role in
optimization because they guarantee that all local minima are global minima. In other words, any
solution found by the solver is guaranteed to be a global minimum.
