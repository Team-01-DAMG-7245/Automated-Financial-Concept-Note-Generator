To clear an initial portfolio from your PortfolioMAD object, use either the PortfolioMAD object or
the setInitPort function with an empty input for the InitPort property. If transaction costs or
turnover constraints are set, it is not possible to clear the InitPort property in this way. In this
case, to clear InitPort, first clear the dependent properties and then clear theInitPort property.
