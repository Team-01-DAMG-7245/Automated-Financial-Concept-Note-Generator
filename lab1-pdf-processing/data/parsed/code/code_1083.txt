The greeks of a particular option are a function of the model used to price the option. However, given
enough different options to work with, a trader can construct a portfolio with any desired values for
its greeks. For example, to insulate the value of an option portfolio from small changes in the price of
the underlying asset, one trader might construct an option portfolio whose delta is zero. Such a
portfolio is then said to be "delta neutral." Another trader may want to protect an option portfolio
from larger changes in the price of the underlying asset, and so might construct a portfolio whose
delta and gamma are both zero. Such a portfolio is both delta and gamma neutral. A third trader may
want to construct a portfolio insulated from small changes in the volatility of the underlying asset in
addition to delta and gamma neutrality. Such a portfolio is then delta, gamma, and vega neutral.
