When you create a creditscorecard object, the data can contain missing values. When using
creditscorecard to create a creditscorecard object, you can set the name-value pair argument
for 'BinMissingData' set to true. In this case, the missing data for numeric predictors (NaN
values) and for categorical predictors (<undefined> values) is binned in a separate bin labeled
<missing> that appears at the end of the bins. Predictors with no missing values in the training data
have no <missing> bin. If you do not specify the 'BinMissingData' argument or if you set
'BinMissingData' to false, the creditscorecard function discards missing observations when
computing frequencies of Good and Bad, and neither the bininfo nor plotbins functions reports
such observations.
