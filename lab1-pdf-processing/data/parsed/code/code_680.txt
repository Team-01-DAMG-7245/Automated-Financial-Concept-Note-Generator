function [TGLR, GLR] = ISTGLR(ISDiffValues)
% ISTGLR function for Total-Gain-to-Loss Ratio for Implementation Shortfalls (IS)
%   This function computes the Total-Gain-to-Loss Ratio (TGLR) and the
%   Gain-to-Loss Ratio (GLR) for a vector of values (IS_Baseline - IS_Agent)
%   where:  
%     - IS_Baseline: Implementation shortfalls for baseline (e.g. TWAP)
%     - IS_Agent: Implementation shortfalls for agent
%
%   Input:
%     - ISDiffValues: Vector of IS difference values (IS_Baseline - IS_Agent)
%
%   Outputs:
%     - TGLR: Total-Gain-to-Loss Ratio computed as the ratio of 
%             Total Positive over Total Negative magnitudes of IS difference
%     - GLR:  Gain-to-Loss Ratio computed as the ratio of 
%             Mean Positive over Mean Negative magnitudes of IS difference
