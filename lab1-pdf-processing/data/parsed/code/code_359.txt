A common approach to select efficient portfolios is to pick a portfolio that has a desired fraction of
the range of expected portfolio returns. To obtain the portfolio that is 30% of the range from the
minimum to maximum return on the efficient frontier, obtain the range of net returns in qret using
the Portfolio object q and interpolate to obtain a 30% level with the interp1 function to obtain a
portfolio qwgt.
