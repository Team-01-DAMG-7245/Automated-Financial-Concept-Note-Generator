This example shows how to include qualitative factors for environmental, social, and corporate
governance (ESG) in the portfolio selection process. The example extends the traditional mean-
variance portfolio using a Portfolio object to include the ESG metric. First, the
estimateFrontier function computes the mean-variance efficient frontier for different ESG levels.
Then, the example illustrates how to combine the ESG performance measure with portfolio
diversification techniques. Specifically, it introduces hybrid models that use the Herfindahl-Hirshman
(HH) index and the most diversified portfolio (MDP) approach using the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function. Finally, the backtestEngine framework
compares the returns and behavior of the different ESG strategies.
