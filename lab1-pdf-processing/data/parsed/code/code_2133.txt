â€¢
The output function F is always a deterministic function of time, F(t), and may always be called
with a single input regardless of the Deterministic flag. The distinction is that when
Deterministic is false, the function F may also be called with a second input, an NVars-by-1
state vector X(t), which is a placeholder and ignored. While F(t) and F(t,X) produce identical
results, the former specifically indicates that the function is a deterministic function of time, and
may offer significant performance benefits in some situations.
