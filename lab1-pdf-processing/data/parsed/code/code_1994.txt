This example backtests an "inverse variance" strategy. The inverse variance rebalance function is
implemeted in the Local Functions on page 15-287 section. For more information on creating
backtest strategies, see backtestStrategy. The inverse variance strategy uses the covariance of
asset returns to make decisions about asset allocation. The LookbackWindow for this strategy must
contain at least 30 days of trailing data (about 6 weeks), and at most, 60 days (about 12 weeks).
