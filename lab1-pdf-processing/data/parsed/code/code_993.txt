To compute scores for a creditscorecard object with constraints for equality, inequality, or bounds
on the coefficients of the logistic regression model, use fitConstrainedModel. Unlike fitmodel,
fitConstrainedModel solves for both the unconstrained and constrained problem. The current
solver used to minimize an objective function for fitConstrainedModel is fmincon, from the
Optimization Toolboxâ„¢.
