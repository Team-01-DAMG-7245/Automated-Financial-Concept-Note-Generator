Note When using the 30/360 day-count basis, it is not always possible to find the exact date
NewDate number of days away because of a known discontinuity in the method of counting days. A
warning is displayed if this occurs.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

NewDate — Date for given number of days away from StartDate
vector

Date for given number of days away from StartDate, returned as a scalar or an N-by-1 vector
containing dates.

If StartDate is a string or date character vector, NewDate is returned as a serial date number. Use
the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If StartDate is a datetime array, then NewDate is returned as a datetime array.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although daysadd supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
