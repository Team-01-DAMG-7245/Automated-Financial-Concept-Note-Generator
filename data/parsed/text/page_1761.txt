More About

Accumulation/Distribution Line

The Accumulation/Distribution line is a technical analysis indicator used to assess the cumulative flow

The Accumulation/Distribution line combines price and volume data to help traders identify trends in
buying and selling pressure. You can use the Accumulation/Distribution Line to determine whether a
stock is being accumulated (bought) or distributed (sold) over a specific period.
