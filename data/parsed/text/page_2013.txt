cfport

Portfolio form of cash flow amounts

Syntax

[CFBondDate,AllDates,AllTF,IndByBond] = cfport(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates)
[CFBondDate,AllDates,AllTF,IndByBond] = cfport( ___ ,TFactors)

Description

[CFBondDate,AllDates,AllTF,IndByBond] = cfport(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates)
computes a vector of all cash flow dates of a bond portfolio, and a matrix mapping the cash flows of
each bond to those dates. Use the matrix for pricing the bonds against a curve of discount factors.

[CFBondDate,AllDates,AllTF,IndByBond] = cfport( ___ ,TFactors) specifies options
using one or more optional arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Calculate the Cash Flow Amounts, Cash Flow Dates, and Time Factors for Each of Two
Bonds

Use the function cfamounts to calculate the cash flow amounts, cash flow dates, and time factors for
each of two bonds. Then use the function cfplot to plot the cash flow diagram.

Settle = '03-Aug-1999';
Maturity = ['15-Aug-2000';'15-Dec-2000'];
CouponRate= [0.06; 0.05];
Period = [3;2];
Basis = [1;0];
[CFlowAmounts, CFlowDates, TFactors] = cfamounts(CouponRate,... 
Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis);
cfplot(CFlowDates,CFlowAmounts)
xlabel('Numeric Cash Flow Dates')
ylabel('Bonds')
