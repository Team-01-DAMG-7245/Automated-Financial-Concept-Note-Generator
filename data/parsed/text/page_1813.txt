More About

Theta

A theta sensitivity measures the rate at which the price of an option decreases as time passes, all else
being equal.

Theta is essentially a quantification of time decay, which is a key concept in options pricing. Theta
provides an estimate of the dollar amount that an option's price would decrease each day, assuming
no movement in the price of the underlying asset and no change in volatility. For example, if a call
option has a theta of -0.05, it means that the option's price is expected to decrease by $0.05 per day,
holding all other factors constant.
