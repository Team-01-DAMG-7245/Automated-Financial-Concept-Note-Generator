Using Maximum and Expected Maximum Drawdown

Introduction

Maximum drawdown is the maximum decline of a series, measured as return, from a peak to a nadir
over a period of time. Although additional metrics exist that are used in the hedge fund and
commodity trading communities (see Pederson and Rudholm-Alfvin [20] in “Bibliography” on page A-
2), the original definition and subsequent implementation of these metrics is not yet standardized.

It is possible to compute analytically the expected maximum drawdown for a Brownian motion with
drift (see Magdon-Ismail, Atiya, Pratap, and Abu-Mostafa [16] “Bibliography” on page A-2). These
results are used to estimate the expected maximum drawdown for a series that approximately follows
a geometric Brownian motion.

Use maxdrawdown and emaxdrawdown to calculate the maximum and expected maximum
drawdowns.

Maximum Drawdown

This example shows how to compute the maximum drawdown (MaxDD) using example data with a
fund, a market, and a cash series.

load FundMarketCash
MaxDD = maxdrawdown(TestData)

MaxDD = 1×3

0.1658    0.3381         0

The maximum drop in the given time period is 16.58% for the fund series and 33.81% for the market.
There is no decline in the cash series, as expected, because the cash account never loses value.

maxdrawdown can also return the indices (MaxDDIndex) of the maximum drawdown intervals for
each series in an optional output argument.

[MaxDD, MaxDDIndex] = maxdrawdown(TestData)

MaxDD = 1×3

0.1658    0.3381         0

MaxDDIndex = 2×3

2     2   NaN
    18    18   NaN

The first two series experience their maximum drawdowns from the second to the 18th month in the
data. The indices for the third series are NaNs because it never has a drawdown.

The 16.58% value loss from month 2 to month 18 for the fund series is verified using the reported
indices.
