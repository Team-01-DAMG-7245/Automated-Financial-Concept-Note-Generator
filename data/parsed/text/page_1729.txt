Output Arguments

ActiveConSet — Transformed portfolio linear inequality constraint matrix expressed in
active weight format
matrix

Transformed portfolio linear inequality constraint matrix expressed in active weight format, returned
in the form [A b] such that A*w <= b. The value w represents a vector of active asset weights
(relative to the index portfolio) whose elements sum to zero.

Algorithms

abs2active transforms a constraint matrix to an equivalent matrix expressed in active weight
format (relative to the index). The transformation equation is

Awabsolute = A wactive + windex ≤babsolute .

Therefore

Awactive ≤babsolute −Awindex = bactive .

The initial constraint matrix consists of NCONSTRAINTS portfolio linear inequality constraints
expressed in absolute weight format. The index portfolio vector contains NASSETS assets.
