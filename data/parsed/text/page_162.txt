setInequality function is the same as using the setGroups function in the example “Specifying
Group Constraints” on page 3-24.

Specifying Group Constraints

This example shows how to solve a portfolo problem using a Portfolio object with group
constraints.

The example “Linear Constraint Equations” on page 3-21 defines a constraint matrix that specifies a
set of typical scenarios. It defines groups of assets, specifies upper and lower bounds for total
allocation in each of these groups, and it sets the total allocation of one group to a fixed value.
Constraints like these are common occurrences. The Portfolio object enables you to simplify the
creation of the constraint matrix for these and other common portfolio requirements.

An alternative approach for solving the portfolio problem is to use the Portfolio object to define:

•
A Group matrix, indicating the assets that belong to each group.

•
A GroupMin vector, indicating the minimum bounds for each group.

•
A GroupMax vector, indicating the maximum bounds for each group.

Based on the table Group Membership, build the Group matrix, with each row representing a group,
and each column representing an asset.

Group = [1    1    0;

         1    0    0;
         0    1    1];

The table Maximum and Minimum Group Exposure has the information to build GroupMin and
GroupMax.
