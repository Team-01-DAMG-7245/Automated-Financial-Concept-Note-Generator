Although bondDefaultBootstrap supports serial date numbers, datetime values are
recommended instead. The datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out
to nanosecond precision, and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
