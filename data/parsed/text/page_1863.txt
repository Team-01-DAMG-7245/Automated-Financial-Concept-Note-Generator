Algorithms

bndkrdur computes the key rate durations for one or more bonds given a zero curve and a set of key
rates. By default, the key rates are each of the zero curve rates. For each key rate, the duration is
computed by shifting the zero curve up and down by a specified amount (ShiftValue) at that
particular key rate, computing the present value of the bond in each case with the new zero curves,
and then evaluating the following:

krduri  =  
(PVdown  − PVup)
(PV  ×  ShiftValue  ×  2)

Note The shift to the curve is computed by shifting the particular key rate by the ShiftValue and
then interpolating the values of the curve in the interval between the previous and next key rates. For
the first key rate, any curve values before the date are equal to the ShiftValue; likewise, for the
last key rate, any curve values after the date are equal to the ShiftValue.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although bndkrdur supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
