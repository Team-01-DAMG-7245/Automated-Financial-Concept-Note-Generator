Convergence

The ECM algorithm does not work for all patterns of missing values. Although it works in most cases,
it can fail to converge if the covariance becomes singular. If this occurs, plots of the log-likelihood
function tend to have a constant upward slope over many iterations as the log of the negative
determinant of the covariance goes to zero. In some cases, the objective fails to converge due to
machine precision errors. No general theory of missing data patterns exists to determine these cases.
An example of a known failure occurs when two time series are proportional wherever both series
contain nonmissing values.
