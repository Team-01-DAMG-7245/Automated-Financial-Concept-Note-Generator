lambda — Lambda
numeric | structure

Lambda, specified as a scalar numeric or structure.

If the input data is a vector, lambda is a scalar. If the input is a financial time series object (tsobj),
lambda is a structure with fields similar to the components of the object. For example, if tsobj
contains series names Open and Close, lambda has fields lambda.Open and lambda.Close.

Data Types: double | struct

Output Arguments

transdat — Data Box-Cox transformation
vector

Data Box-Cox transformation, returned as a vector.

lambda — Lambda transformation parameter
numeric

Lambda transformation parameter, returned as a numeric.

More About

Box Cox Transformation

boxcox transforms nonnormally distributed data to a set of data that has approximately normal
distribution. The Box-Cox transformation is a family of power transformations.

If λ is not = 0, then

data(λ) = dataλ −1
λ

If λ is = 0, then

data(λ) = log(data)

The logarithm is the natural logarithm (log base e). The algorithm calls for finding the λ value that
maximizes the Log-Likelihood Function (LLF). The search is conducted using fminsearch.

Introduced before R2006a

R2023a: fints support for tsobj input argument and transfts output argument are
removed
Behavior changed in R2023a

The tsobj input argument that supports a fints object is and the transfts output argument are
removed from boxcox.
