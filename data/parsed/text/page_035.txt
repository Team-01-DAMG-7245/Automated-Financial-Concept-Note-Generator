which shows the closing values of 100, 500, and 300 shares of each stock, not the portfolio value, and
this is meaningless for this example.

Computing Dot Products of Vectors

In matrix algebra, if X and Y are vectors of the same length

Y = y1, y2, …, yn

X = x1, x2, …, xn

then the dot product

X · Y = x1y1 + x2y2 + … + xnyn

is the scalar product of the two vectors. It is an exception to the commutative rule. To compute the
dot product in MATLAB, use sum(X .* Y) or sum(Y .* X). Be sure that the two vectors have the
same dimensions. To illustrate, use the previous vectors.

Value = sum(NumShares .* ClosePrices')

Value =

3.5413e+004

Value = sum(ClosePrices .* NumShares')

Value =

3.5413e+004

As expected, the value in these cases matches the PortfValue computed previously.

Multiplying Vectors and Matrices

Multiplying vectors and matrices follows the matrix multiplication rules and process. For example, a
portfolio matrix contains closing prices for a week. A second matrix (vector) contains the stock
quantities in the portfolio.

WeekClosePr = [42.5     15      78.875
               42.125   15.5    78.75
               42.125   15.125  79
               42.625   15.25   78.875
               43       15.25   78.625];
PortQuan = [100
            500
            300];

To see the closing portfolio value for each day, simply multiply

WeekPortValue = WeekClosePr * PortQuan

WeekPortValue =

1.0e+004 *

3.5412
    3.5587
