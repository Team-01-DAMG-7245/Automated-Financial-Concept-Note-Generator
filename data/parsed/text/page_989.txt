Case Study for Credit Scorecard Analysis

This example shows how to create a creditscorecard object, bin data, display, and plot binned
data information. This example also shows how to fit a logistic regression model, obtain a score for
the scorecard model, and determine the probabilities of default and validate the credit scorecard
model using three different metrics.

Step 1. Create a creditscorecard object.

Use the CreditCardData.mat file to load the data (using a dataset from Refaat 2011). If your data
contains many predictors, you can first use screenpredictors (Risk Management Toolbox) to pare
down a potentially large set of predictors to a subset that is most predictive of the credit scorecard
response variable. You can then use this subset of predictors when creating the creditscorecard
object. In addition, you can use Threshold Predictors (Risk Management Toolbox) to interactively set
credit scorecard predictor thresholds using the output from screenpredictors (Risk Management
Toolbox).

When creating a creditscorecard object, by default, 'ResponseVar' is set to the last column in
the data ('status' in this example) and the 'GoodLabel' to the response value with the highest
count (0 in this example). The syntax for creditscorecard indicates that 'CustID' is the 'IDVar'
to remove from the list of predictors. Also, while not demonstrated in this example, when creating a
creditscorecard object using creditscorecard, you can use the optional name-value pair
argument 'WeightsVar' to specify observation (sample) weights or 'BinMissingData' to bin
missing data.

The variables in CreditCardData are customer ID, customer age, time at current address,
residential status, employment status, customer income, time with bank, other credit card, average
monthly balance, utilization rate, and the default status (response).

sc = creditscorecard(data,'IDVar','CustID')

sc = 
  creditscorecard with properties:

GoodLabel: 0
              ResponseVar: 'status'
               WeightsVar: ''
