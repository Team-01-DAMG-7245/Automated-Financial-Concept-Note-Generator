Plotting Sensitivities of an Option

This example creates a three-dimensional plot showing how gamma changes relative to price for a
Black-Scholes option.

Recall that gamma is the second derivative of the option price relative to the underlying security
price. The plot in this example shows a three-dimensional surface whose z-value is the gamma of an
option as price (x-axis) and time (y-axis) vary. The plot adds yet a fourth dimension by showing option
delta (the first derivative of option price to security price) as the color of the surface. First set the
price range of the options, and set the time range to one year divided into half-months and expressed
as fractions of a year.

Range = 10:70;
Span = length(Range);
j = 1:0.5:12;
Newj = j(ones(Span,1),:)'/12;

For each time period, create a vector of prices from 10 to 70 and create a matrix of all ones.

JSpan = ones(length(j),1);
NewRange = Range(JSpan,:);
Pad = ones(size(Newj));

Calculate the gamma and delta sensitivities (greeks) using the blsgamma and blsdelta functions.
Gamma is the second derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price, and delta is the
first derivative of the option price with respect to the stock price. The exercise price is $40, the risk-
free interest rate is 10%, and volatility is 0.35 for all prices and periods.

ZVal = blsgamma(NewRange, 40*Pad, 0.1*Pad, Newj, 0.35*Pad);
Color = blsdelta(NewRange, 40*Pad, 0.1*Pad, Newj, 0.35*Pad);

Display the greeks as a function of price and time. Gamma is the z-axis; delta is the color.
