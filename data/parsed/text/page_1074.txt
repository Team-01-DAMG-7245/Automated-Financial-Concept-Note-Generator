Feasible Generalized Least Squares With Missing Data

Estimate parameters using ecmlsrmle:

[Parameters, Covar0] = ecmlsrmle(Data, Design);
[Parameters, Covariance] = ecmlsrmle(Data, Design, [], [], [], [], Covar0);

Estimate standard errors using ecmmvnrstd:

StdParameters = ecmmvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);

Seemingly Unrelated Regression

Given a multivariate normal regression model in standard form with a Data matrix and a Design
array, it is possible to convert the problem into a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) problem by a
simple transformation of the Design array. The main idea of SUR is that instead of having a common
parameter vector over all data series, you have a separate parameter vector associated with each
separate series or with distinct groups of series that, nevertheless, share a common residual
covariance. It is this ability to aggregate and disaggregate series and to perform comparative tests on
each design that is the power of SUR.

To make the transformation, use the function convert2sur, which converts a standard-form design
array into an equivalent design array to do SUR with a specified mapping of the series into
NUMGROUPS groups. The regression functions are used in the usual manner, but with the SUR design
array instead of the original design array. Instead of having NUMPARAMS elements, the SUR output
parameter vector has NUMGROUPS of stacked parameter estimates, where the first NUMPARAMS
elements of Parameters contain parameter estimates associated with the first group of series, the
next NUMPARAMS elements of Parameters contain parameter estimates associated with the second
group of series, and so on. If the model has only one series, for example, NUMSERIES = 1, then the
SUR design array is the same as the original design array since SUR requires two or more series to
generate distinct parameter estimates.

Given NUMPARAMS parameters and NUMGROUPS groups with a parameter vector (Parameters) with
NUMGROUPS * NUMPARAMS elements from any of the regression routines, the following MATLAB
code fragment shows how to print a table of SUR parameter estimates with rows that correspond to
each parameter and columns that correspond to each group or series:

fprintf(1,'Seemingly Unrelated Regression Parameter
   Estimates\n');
fprintf(1,'   %7s ',' ');
fprintf(1,'  Group(%3d) ',1:NumGroups);
fprintf(1,'\n');
for i = 1:NumParams
    fprintf(1,'   %7d ',i);
    ii = i;
        for j = 1:NumGroups
            fprintf(1,'%12g ',Param(ii));
            ii = ii + NumParams;
            end
            fprintf(1,'\n');
end
fprintf(1,'\n');
