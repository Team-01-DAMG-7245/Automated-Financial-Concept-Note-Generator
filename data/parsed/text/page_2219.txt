emaxdrawdown

Compute expected maximum drawdown for Brownian motion

Syntax

ExpDrawdown = emaxdrawdown(Mu,Sigma,T)

Description

ExpDrawdown = emaxdrawdown(Mu,Sigma,T) computes the expected maximum drawdown for a
Brownian motion for each time period in T using the following equation:

dX t = μdt + σdW t .

If the Brownian motion is geometric with the stochastic differential equation

dS t = μ0S t dt + σ0S t dW t

then use Ito's lemma with X(t) = log(S(t)) such that

μ = μ0 −0.5σ02,

σ = σ0

converts it to the form used here.

Examples

Compute Expected Maximum Drawdown

This example shows how to use log-return moments of a fund to compute the expected maximum
drawdown (EMaxDD) and then compare it with the realized maximum drawdown (MaxDD).

load FundMarketCash
logReturns = log(TestData(2:end,:) ./ TestData(1:end - 1,:));
Mu = mean(logReturns(:,1));
Sigma = std(logReturns(:,1),1);
T = size(logReturns,1);

MaxDD = maxdrawdown(TestData(:,1),'geometric')

MaxDD = 
0.1813

EMaxDD = emaxdrawdown(Mu, Sigma, T)

EMaxDD = 
0.1545

The drawdown observed in this time period is above the expected maximum drawdown. There is no
contradiction here. The expected maximum drawdown is not an upper bound on the maximum losses
from a peak, but an estimate of their average, based on a geometric Brownian motion assumption.
