Choosing and Controlling the Solver for PortfolioMAD
Optimizations

When solving portfolio optimizations for a PortfolioMAD object, you are solving nonlinear
optimization problems with either nonlinear objective or nonlinear constraints. You can use
'TrustRegionCP' (default) or 'ExtendedCP' solvers that implement Kelley’s cutting plane method
(see Kelley [45] at “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5). Alternatively, you can use fmincon and
all variations of fmincon from Optimization Toolbox are supported. When using fmincon as the
solverType, 'sqp' is the default algorithm for fmincon.

Using 'TrustRegionCP' and 'ExtendedCP' SolverTypes

The 'TrustRegionCP' and 'ExtendedCP' solvers have options to control the number iterations
and stopping tolerances. Moreover, these solvers use linprog as the primary solver, and all
linprog options are supported using optimoptions structures. All these options are set using
setSolver.

For example, you can use setSolver to increase the number of iterations for 'TrustRegionCP':

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setSolver(p, 'TrustRegionCP', 'MaxIterations', 2000);
display(p.solverType)
display(p.solverOptions)

trustregioncp
                MaxIterations: 2000
         AbsoluteGapTolerance: 1.0000e-07
         RelativeGapTolerance: 1.0000e-05
       NonlinearScalingFactor: 1000
       ObjectiveScalingFactor: 1000
          MainSolverOptions: [1×1 optim.options.Linprog]
                      Display: 'off'
                CutGeneration: 'basic'
     MaxIterationsInactiveCut: 30
           ActiveCutTolerance: 1.0000e-07
                  ShrinkRatio: 0.7500
    TrustRegionStartIteration: 2
                   DeltaLimit: 1

To change the primary solver algorithm to 'interior-point', with no display, use setSolver to
modify 'MainSolverOptions':

p = PortfolioMAD;
options = optimoptions('linprog','Algorithm','interior-point','Display','off');
p = setSolver(p,'TrustRegionCP','MainSolverOptions',options);
display(p.solverType)
display(p.solverOptions)
display(p.solverOptions.MainSolverOptions.Algorithm)
display(p.solverOptions.MainSolverOptions.Display)

trustregioncp
                MaxIterations: 1000
         AbsoluteGapTolerance: 1.0000e-07
         RelativeGapTolerance: 1.0000e-05
       NonlinearScalingFactor: 1000
       ObjectiveScalingFactor: 1000
          MainSolverOptions: [1×1 optim.options.Linprog]
