In other words, while delta tells you how much the price of an option might move, gamma tells you
how fast the option's delta itself will change as the price of the underlying asset moves. For instance,
if an option has a gamma of 0.10, its delta is expected to change by 0.10 for every $1 move in the
underlying asset's price.
