More About

Accumulation/Distribution Oscillator

The Accumulation/Distribution oscillator is a technical analysis indicator used to assess the strength
of a trend by measuring the relationship between price movement and volume.

The Accumulation/Distribution oscillator helps traders determine whether an asset is being
accumulated (bought) or distributed (sold) over time and can help identify divergences between price
action and volume, which may indicate potential reversals.
