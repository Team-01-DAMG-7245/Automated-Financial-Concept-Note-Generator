More About

Bollinger Band

The Bollinger band is a technical analysis indicator used to measure market volatility and identify
potential overbought or oversold conditions in a time series of price data.

The Bollinger bands consist of a middle band and two outer bands that expand and contract based on
market volatility. Widening bands indicate increased volatility and potential price swings and
narrowing bands suggest decreased volatility and potential price consolidation.
