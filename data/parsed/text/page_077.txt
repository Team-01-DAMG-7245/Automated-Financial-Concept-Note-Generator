Furthermore, you can aggregate simple returns through time using the formula

ps(T)
ps(1) −1 = ∏
t = 2

T

rs(t) + 1 −1,

where the left-hand side represents the simple return over the entire interval [0,T].

Continuous returns add 1 to PC to move the range to (0,∞), the domain of the real logarithm.
Continuous returns have the time aggregation property

log pc(T)
pc(1) −1 = log ∏
t = 2

T
pc(t)
pc(t −1)
= ∑
t = 2

T
log
pc(t)
pc(t −1) = ∑
t = 2

T
rc(t) .

This transformation ensures additivity of compound returns.

If negative prices are allowed, the range of simple returns PC expands to (−∞,∞), that is, anything
from unlimited loss to unlimited gain. In the formula for continuous returns, logarithms of negative
numbers are unavoidable. The logarithm of a negative number is not a mathematical problem
because the complex logarithm (the MATLAB default) interprets negative numbers as complex
numbers with phase angle ±π, so that, for example,

−2 = 2eiπ

log( −2) = 2 + iπ

If x < 0, log(x) = log(|x|) ± iπ. The log of a negative number has an imaginary part of ±π. The log of 0
is undefined because the range of the exponential eiθ is positive. Therefore, zero prices (that is, free
exchanges) are unsupported.

Analysis of Negative Price Returns

To illustrate negative price inputs, consider the following price series and its simple returns.

p = [3; 1; -2; -1; 1]

p =

3
     1
    -2
    -1
     1

rs = tick2ret(p)

rs =

-0.6667
   -3.0000
   -0.5000
   -2.0000
