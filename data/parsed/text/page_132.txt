The conservative LSTM neural network predicts into the constant class for all validation
observations. The 91% accuracy comes for free because this model acts like the naive model
discussed in Engineer Features and Prepare Response Variable on page 2-79, which only ever
predicts into the constant class. Such a model does not make money.

[predScoresRLSTM] = minibatchpredict(RiskyLSTMMdl,XV,InputDataFormats="CTB");
predYRLSTM = scores2label(predScoresRLSTM,classes);
accRiskyV = 100*mean(predYRLSTM == yV)

accRiskyV = 
60.8731
