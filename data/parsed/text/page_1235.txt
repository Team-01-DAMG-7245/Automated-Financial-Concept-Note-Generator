Dynamic Behavior of Market Parameters

As discussed in “Creating SDE Objects” on page 14-7, object parameters may be evaluated as if they
are MATLAB® functions accessible by a common interface. This accessibility provides the impression
of dynamic behavior regardless of whether the underlying parameters are truly time-varying.
Furthermore, because parameters are accessible by a common interface, seemingly simple linear
constructs may in fact represent complex, nonlinear designs.

For example, consider a univariate geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model of the form:

In this model, the return, μ(t), and volatility,σ(t), are dynamic parameters of time alone. However,
when creating a gbm object to represent the underlying model, such dynamic behavior must be
