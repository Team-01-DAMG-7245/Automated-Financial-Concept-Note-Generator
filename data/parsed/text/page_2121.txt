days360

Days between dates based on 360-day year

Syntax

NumDays = days360(StartDate,EndDate)

Description

NumDays = days360(StartDate,EndDate) returns the number of days between StartDate and
EndDate based on a 360-day year (that is, all months contain 30 days). If EndDate is earlier than
StartDate, NumDays is negative.

Either input argument can contain multiple values, but if so, the other must contain the same number
of values or a single value that applies to all. For example, if StartDate is an n-row datetime, then
EndDate must be an N-by-1 vector of integers or a single integer. NumDays is then an N-by-1 vector of
date numbers.

Examples

Determine the Number of Days Between Two Dates Based on a 360-Day Year

Determine the NumDays using date character vectors for StartDate and EndDate.

NumDays = days360('15-jan-2000', '15-mar-2000')

NumDays = 
60

Determine the NumDays using a datetime for StartDate and EndDate.

NumDays = days360(datetime(2000,1,15) , datetime(2000,3,15))

NumDays = 
60

Determine the NumDays using a datetime array for EndDate.

MoreDays = [datetime(2000,3,15) ; datetime(2000,4,15) ; datetime(2000,6,15)];
NumDays = days360(datetime(2000,1,15), MoreDays)

NumDays = 3Ã—1
