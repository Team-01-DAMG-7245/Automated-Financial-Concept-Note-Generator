Forward starting date of coupon payments after the Settle date, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'StartDate' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string
array, or date character vectors.

Note To make an instrument forward starting, specify StartDate as a future date.

If you do not specify a StartDate, the effective start date is the Settle date.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Face — Face value of bond
100 (default) | numeric

Face value of the bond, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Face' and a scalar or a
NBONDS-by-1 vector.

Note CouponRate and Face can change over the life of the bond. Schedules for CouponRate and
Face can be specified with an NBONDS-by-1 cell array where each element is a NumDates-by-2 matrix
or cell array, where the first column is dates (serial date numbers or character vectors) and the
second column is associated rates. The date indicates the last day that the coupon rate or face value
is valid. This means that the corresponding CouponRate and Face value applies "on or before" the
specified ending date.

When the corresponding Face value is used to compute the coupon cashflow on the specified ending
date. Three things happen on the specified ending date:

1
The last coupon corresponding to the current Face value is paid.

2
The principal differential (between the current and the next Face value) is paid.

3
The date marks the beginning of the period with the next Face value, for which the cashflow
does not occur until later.

Data Types: double | cell | char

AdjustCashFlowsBasis — Adjusts cash flows according to accrual amount based on actual
period day count
false (default) | logical with a value of true or false

Adjusts cash flows according to the accrual amount based on the actual period day count, specified as
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'AdjustCashFlowsBasis' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1
vector.

Data Types: logical

BusinessDayConvention — Business day conventions
'actual' (default) | character vector with values'actual', 'follow', 'modifiedfollow',
'previous'or 'modifiedprevious'

Business day conventions, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BusinessDayConvention' and a scalar or NBONDS-by-1 cell array of character vectors of business
