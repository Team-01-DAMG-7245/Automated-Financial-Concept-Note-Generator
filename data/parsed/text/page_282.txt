Choosing and Controlling the Solver for Mean-Variance
Portfolio Optimization

The default solver for mean-variance portfolio optimization is lcprog, which implements a linear
complementarity programming (LCP) algorithm. Although lcprog works for most problems, you can
adjust arguments to control the algorithm. Alternatively, the mean-variance portfolio optimization
tools let you use any of the variations of quadprog from Optimization Toolbox™ software. Like
Optimization Toolbox, which uses the interior-point-convex algorithm as the default algorithm
for quadprog, the portfolio optimization tools also use the interior-point-convex algorithm as
the default. For details about quadprog and quadratic programming algorithms and options, see
“Quadratic Programming Algorithms”.

Using 'lcprog' and 'quadprog'

To modify either lcprog or to specify quadprog as your solver, use the setSolver function to set
the hidden properties solverType and solverOptions that specify and control the solver. Because
the solver properties are hidden, you cannot set these options using the Portfolio object. The
default solver is lcprog so you do not need to use setSolver to specify this solver. To use
quadprog, you can set the default interior-point-convex algorithm of quadprog using this
code:

p = Portfolio;
p = setSolver(p, 'quadprog');
display(p.solverType)
display(p.solverOptions)

quadprog options:

Options used by current Algorithm ('interior-point-convex'):
   (Other available algorithms: 'active-set', 'trust-region-reflective')

Set properties:
              Algorithm: 'interior-point-convex'
                Display: 'off'
    OptimalityTolerance: 1.0000e-12

Default properties:
    ConstraintTolerance: 1.0000e-08
           LinearSolver: 'auto'
          MaxIterations: 200
          StepTolerance: 1.0000e-12

You can switch back to lcprog with this code:

p = setSolver(p, 'lcprog');
display(p.solverType);
display(p.solverOptions)

lcprog
     MaxIter: []
    TieBreak: []
      TolPiv: 5.0000e-08

In both cases, setSolver sets up default options associated with either solver. If you want to specify
additional options associated with a given solver, setSolver accepts these options with name-value
