Integer (Binary)
Variables

"Always" case with
Financial Toolbox

•
Return — Gross
portfolio returns or
net portfolio returns

•
Risk — Variance,
CVaR, or MAD

•
Sharpe ratio (only
for mean-variance
problems using
Portfolio object)

•
Continuous convex
functions (only using
the Portfolio
object)

•
Return — Gross
portfolio returns or
net portfolio returns

•
Risk — Variance,
CVaR, or MAD (risk
constraints are only
supported when the
objective is the
return)

•
Linear equalities

•
Linear inequalities

•
Tracking error (only
for mean-variance
problems using
Portfolio object).
Tracking error is
supported with
custom objectives
using
estimateCustomOb
jectivePortfolio
. Tracking error is
only supported when
the objective is the
return, variance, or
Sharpe ratio.

•
Turnover

•
Bounds on the
number of assets

•
Conditional budget
constraint (an upper
bound on the sum of
all assets that go
above a specified
threshold)

•
Conditional
(semicontinuous)
bounds (for example,
if asset i is selected,
then xi ≥ lbi,
otherwise xi = 0)
