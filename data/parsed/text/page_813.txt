Setting Up an Initial or Current Portfolio

In many applications, creating a new optimal portfolio requires comparing the new portfolio with an
initial or current portfolio to form lists of purchases and sales. The PortfolioMAD object property
InitPort lets you identify an initial or current portfolio. The initial portfolio also plays an essential
role if you have either transaction costs or turnover constraints. The initial portfolio need not be
feasible within the constraints of the problem. This can happen if the weights in a portfolio have
shifted such that some constraints become violated. To check if your initial portfolio is feasible, use
the checkFeasibility function described in “Validating MAD Portfolios” on page 6-81. Suppose
that you have an initial portfolio in x0, then use the PortfolioMAD object to set up an initial
portfolio:

x0 = [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ];
p = PortfolioMAD('InitPort', x0);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.3000
 0.2000
 0.2000
      0

As with all array properties, you can set InitPort with scalar expansion. This is helpful to set up an
equally weighted initial portfolio of, for example, 10 assets:

p = PortfolioMAD('NumAssets', 10, 'InitPort', 1/10);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000
 0.1000

To clear an initial portfolio from your PortfolioMAD object, use either the PortfolioMAD object or
the setInitPort function with an empty input for the InitPort property. If transaction costs or
turnover constraints are set, it is not possible to clear the InitPort property in this way. In this
case, to clear InitPort, first clear the dependent properties and then clear theInitPort property.

The InitPort property can also be set with setInitPort which lets you specify the number of
assets if you want to use scalar expansion. For example, given an initial portfolio in x0, use
setInitPort to set the InitPort property:

p = PortfolioMAD;
x0 = [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ];
p = setInitPort(p, x0);
disp(p.InitPort)

0.3000
 0.2000
 0.2000
      0
