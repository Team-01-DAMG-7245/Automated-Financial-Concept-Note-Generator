Covariance — User-supplied estimate for covariance matrix of residuals of the regression
vector

(Optional) User-supplied estimate for the covariance matrix of the residuals of the regression,
specified as an NUMPARAMS-by-1 column vector.

ecmlsrobj requires that Covariance be positive-definite.

Note that

ecmlsrobj(Data, Design, Parameters) = ecmmvnrobj(Data, Design, Parameters, IdentityMatrix)

where IdentityMatrix is a NUMSERIES-by-NUMSERIES identity matrix.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

Objective — Least-squares objective function
scalar

Least-squares objective function, returned as scalar.

More About

Least Squares Regression

Least squares regression is a statistical method used to estimate the relationships between variables.

Least squares regression is commonly employed in linear regression analysis to find the best-fitting
line through a set of data points. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences
(residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
