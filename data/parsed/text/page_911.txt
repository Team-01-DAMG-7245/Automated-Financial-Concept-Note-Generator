Introduction

Use lower partial moments to examine what is colloquially known as “downside risk.” The main idea
of the lower partial moment framework is to model moments of asset returns that fall below a
minimum acceptable level of return. To compute lower partial moments from data, use lpm to
calculate lower partial moments for multiple asset return series and for multiple moment orders. To
compute expected values for lower partial moments under several assumptions about the distribution
of asset returns, use elpm to calculate lower partial moments for multiple assets and for multiple
orders.

Sample Lower Partial Moments

This example shows how to use lpm to compute the zero-order, first-order, and second-order lower
partial moments for the three time series, where the mean of the third time series is used to compute
MAR (minimum acceptable return) with the so-called risk-free rate.

load FundMarketCash 
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
Assets

Assets = 1×3 cell
    {'Fund'}    {'Market'}    {'Cash'}

MAR = mean(Returns(:,3))

MAR = 
0.0017

LPM = lpm(Returns, MAR, [0 1 2])

LPM = 3×3

0.4333    0.4167    0.6167
    0.0075    0.0140    0.0004
    0.0003    0.0008    0.0000

The first row of LPM contains zero-order lower partial moments of the three series. The fund and
market index fall below MAR about 40% of the time and cash returns fall below its own mean about
60% of the time.

The second row contains first-order lower partial moments of the three series. The fund and market
have large average shortfall returns relative to MAR by 75 and 140 basis points per month. On the
other hand, cash underperforms MAR by about only four basis points per month on the downside.
