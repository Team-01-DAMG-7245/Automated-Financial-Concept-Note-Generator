cfamounts can be used to generate CFlowDates.

Data Types: datetime

CFlowAmounts — Matrix of cash flow amounts
vector

Matrix of cash flow amounts, specified as a NINST-by-(Number of cash flows) matrix of cash
flow amounts, with empty entries padded with NaNs. The CFlowAmounts matrix must be the same
size as CFlowDates.

cfamounts can be used to generate CFlowAmounts.

Data Types: double

ax — Valid axis object
object

(Optional) Valid axis object, specified as an ax object that is created using axes. The plot will be
created in the axes specified by the optional ax argument instead of in the current axes (gca). The
optional argument ax can precede any of the input argument combinations.

Data Types: object

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: cfplot(CFlowDates,CFlowAmounts,'Groups',{[2
3]},'ShowAmnt',1,'DateFormat',6,'DateSpacing',100)

Groups — Group cash flows
'off' (default) | character vector with value 'off' or 'individual' | cell array of character
vectors

Group cash flows, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Groups' and the following
values:

•
'off' — Show all instruments in one set of axes, arranged from top to bottom.

•
'individual' — Generate subplots and plot each instrument in its own axis.

•
GRP — Cell array of instrument groups, {Group1, Group2,... }. This generates subplots and
plots each group in each axis. When specifying {Group1, Group2,... }, each Group must be
mutually exclusive vectors of INSTIndex. Unspecified instruments are not shown in the grouped
plot.

Data Types: char | cell

Stacked — Stack arrows if cash flows are in same direction on same day
ignored when 'Groups' is 'off', otherwise 'off' (default) | character vector with values 'off',
'all', or 'GRPIndex'
