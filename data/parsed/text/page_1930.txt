The parties involved are:

•
Protection Buyer — The party that purchases the CDS to protect against the risk of default. They
pay periodic premiums (known as the CDS spread) to the protection seller.

•
Protection Seller — The party that provides the credit protection and receives the premiums
from the protection buyer. In the event of a default, the protection seller is obligated to
compensate the protection buyer.

Algorithms

If the time to default is denoted by τ, the default probability curve, or function, PD(t), and its
complement, the survival function Q(t), are given by:

PD(t) = P[τ ≤t] = 1 −P[τ > t] = 1 −Q(t)

In the standard model, the survival probability is defined in terms of a piecewise constant hazard rate
h(t). For example, if h(t) =

λ1, for 0 ≤t ≤ t1

λ2, for t1 < t ≤ t2

λ3, for t2 <t

then the survival function is given by Q(t) =

e−λ1t, for 0 ≤ t ≤ t1

e−λ1t −λ2(t −t1), for t1 < t ≤ t2

e−λ1t1 −λ2(t2 −t1) −λ3(t −t2), for t2 < t

Given n market dates t1,...,tn and corresponding market CDS spreads S1,...,Sn, cdsbootstrap
calibrates the parameters λ1,...,λn and evaluates PD(t) on the market dates, or an optional user-
defined set of dates.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cdsbootstrap supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead.
The datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond
precision, and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)
