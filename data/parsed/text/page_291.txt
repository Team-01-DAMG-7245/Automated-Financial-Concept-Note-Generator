The returns and risks are at the periodicity of the moments of asset returns so that, if you have values
for AssetMean and AssetCovar in terms of monthly returns, the estimates for portfolio risk and
return are in terms of monthly returns as well. In addition, the estimate for portfolio risk in the mean-
variance case is the standard deviation of portfolio returns, not the variance of portfolio returns.
