As expected, the simulation error decreases as the number of intermediate time steps increases.
Because the intermediate states are not reported, all simulated time series have the same number of
observations regardless of the actual value of NSteps.

Furthermore, since the previously simulated exact solutions are correct for any number of
intermediate time steps, additional computations are not needed for this example. In fact, this
assessment is correct. The exact solutions are sampled at intermediate times to ensure that the
simulation uses the same sequence of Gaussian random variates in the same order. Without this
assurance, there is no way to compare simulated prices on a pathwise basis. However, there might be
valid reasons for sampling exact solutions at closely spaced intervals, such as pricing path-dependent
options.
