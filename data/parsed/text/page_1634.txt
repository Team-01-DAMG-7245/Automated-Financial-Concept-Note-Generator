simByEuler

Simulate RVM, roughbergomi, or roughheston sample paths by Euler approximation

Syntax

[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler(MDL,NPeriods)
[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler( ___ ,Name=Value)

Description

[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler(MDL,NPeriods) simulates NTrials sample paths of NVars
correlated state variables driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods
consecutive observation periods. simByEuler uses a rvm, roughbergomi, or roughheston object
to simulate a rough volatility model with a Brownian semistationary process (BSS) without drift.

[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler( ___ ,Name=Value) specifies options using one or more name-
value arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

You can perform quasi-Monte Carlo simulations using the name-value arguments for
MonteCarloMethod, QuasiSequence, and BrownianMotionMethod. For more information, see
“Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation” on page 14-63.

Examples

Simulate Rough Volatility Model Sample Paths by Euler Approximation

The rough volatility model (RVM) in a rvm object is a bivariate composite model, composed of two
coupled and dissimilar univariate models, each driven by a single Brownian motion source of risk
over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time rough stochastic
volatility processes.

Create an rvm object.

Return = 0.03;
Volatility = 0.2;
Alpha = 0.03;
Beta = 0.015;

rvmObj = rvm(Return,Volatility,Alpha,Beta,KernelType="gamma")

rvmObj =
