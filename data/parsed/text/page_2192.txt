Maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the covariance of the Data using the ECM algorithm,
specified as a NUMSERIES-by-NUMSERIES matrix.

InvCovar — Cholesky decomposition of covariance matrix
[ ] (default) | matrix

(Optional) Inverse of covariance matrix, specified as a matrix using inv as:

inv(Covariance)

Data Types: double

MatrixType — Matrix format
'full' (default) | character vector

(Optional) Matrix format, specified as a character vector with a value of:

•
'full' — Computes the full Fisher information matrix.

•
'meanonly' — Computes only the components of the Fisher information matrix associated with
the mean.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

Fisher — Fisher information matrix
matrix

Fisher information matrix, returned as an NUMPARAMSNUMPARAMS matrix based on current parameter
estimates, where NUMPARAMS = NUMSERIES * (NUMSERIES + 3)/2 if the MatrixFormat =
'full'. If the MatrixFormat = 'meanonly', then the NUMPARAMS = NUMSERIES.

More About

Fisher Information Matrix

The Fisher information matrix is a key concept in statistics and information theory that measures the
amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter upon
which the probability of the random variable depends.

The Fisher information matrix is used to evaluate the efficiency of estimators and to derive
confidence intervals.
