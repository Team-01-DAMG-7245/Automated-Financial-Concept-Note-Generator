Bond Prices and Yield Curve Parallel Shifts

This example uses Financial Toolbox™ bond pricing functions to evaluate the impact of time-to-
maturity and yield variation on the price of a bond portfolio. Also, this example shows how to
visualize the price behavior of a portfolio of bonds over a wide range of yield curve scenarios, and as
time progresses toward maturity.

Specify values for the settlement date, maturity date, face value, coupon rate, and coupon payment
periodicity of a four-bond portfolio. For simplicity, accept default values for the end-of-month payment
rule (rule in effect) and day-count basis (actual/actual). Also, synchronize the coupon payment
structure to the maturity date (no odd first or last coupon dates). Any inputs for which defaults are
accepted are set to empty matrices ([]) as placeholders where appropriate. Also, specify the points
on the yield curve for each bond.

Settle     = datetime(1995,1,15);
Maturity   = datetime( [2020, 4, 3;...
                        2025, 5,14;...
                        2019, 6, 9;...
                        2019, 2,25])

Maturity = 4×1 datetime
   03-Apr-2020
   14-May-2025
   09-Jun-2019
   25-Feb-2019

Face       = [1000; 1000; 1000; 1000];
CouponRate = [0; 0.05; 0; 0.055];
Periods    = [0; 2; 0; 2];

Yields = [0.078; 0.09; 0.075; 0.085];

Use Financial Toolbox functions to calculate the true bond prices as the sum of the quoted price plus
accrued interest.

[CleanPrice, AccruedInterest] = bndprice(Yields,... 
CouponRate,Settle, Maturity, Periods,...
[], [], [], [], [], [], Face);

Prices  =  CleanPrice + AccruedInterest

Prices = 4×1

145.2452
  594.7757
  165.8949
  715.7584

Assume that the value of each bond is $25,000, and determine the quantity of each bond such that
the portfolio value is $100,000.

BondAmounts = 25000 ./ Prices;

Compute the portfolio price for a rolling series of settlement dates over a range of yields. The
evaluation dates occur annually on January 15, beginning on 15-Jan-1995 (settlement) and extending
