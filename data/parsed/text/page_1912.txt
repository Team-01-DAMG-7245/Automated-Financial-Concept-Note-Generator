Holiday — Holiday and nontrading-day dates
if Holiday is [ ] holiday dates are based on United States holidays specified by holidays (default)
| datetime array | string array | date character vector

Holiday and nontrading-day dates, specified as a vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. If you specify Holiday, you must also supply the frequency bdmode. Using a
Holiday value of NaN uses a holiday list that has no dates.

To support existing code, busdays also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

bdates — Business days
column vector

Business days, returned as a column vector of business dates, in datetime format (if sdate, edate,
or Holiday are in datetime format). Business dates can exist before and/or after the specified sdate
and edate.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although busdays supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
