Irregular or normal last coupon date, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS
vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, cfdatesq also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

PeriodsBeforeSettle — Number of quasi-coupon dates on or before settlement to include
0 (default) | nonnegative integer

(Optional) Number of quasi-coupon dates on or before settlement to include, specified as a
nonnegative integer.

Data Types: double

PeriodsAfterMaturity — Number of quasi-coupon dates after maturity to include
0 (default) | nonnegative integer

(Optional) Number of quasi-coupon dates after maturity to include, specified as a nonnegative
integer.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

QuasiCouponDates — Quasi-coupon dates
matrix

Quasi-coupon dates, returned as a N-row matrix of dates in datetime format (if any inputs are in
datetime format). QuasiCouponDates has NUMBONDS rows and the number of columns is determined
by the maximum number of quasi-coupon dates required to hold the bond portfolio. NaNs are padded
for bonds which have less than the maximum number quasi-coupon dates. By default, quasi-coupon
dates after settlement and on or preceding maturity are returned. If settlement occurs on maturity,
and maturity is a quasi-coupon date, then the maturity date is returned.

If all of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, or LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then QuasiCouponDates is returned as a serial date
number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, or LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then QuasiCouponDates is returned as a datetime array.

A quasi coupon is a term used in the context of certain fixed-income securities, particularly bonds,

different manner.
