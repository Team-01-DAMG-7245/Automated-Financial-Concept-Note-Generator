Input Arguments

Vector and Matrix Input

By design, MATLAB software can efficiently perform repeated operations on collections of data stored
in vectors and matrices. MATLAB code that is written to operate simultaneously on different arrays is
said to be vectorized. Vectorized code is not only clean and concise, but is also efficiently processed
by MATLAB.

Because MATLAB is optimized for processing vectorized code, many Financial Toolbox functions
accept either vector or matrix input arguments, rather than single (scalar) values.

One example of such a function is the irr function, which computes the internal rate of return of a
cash flow stream. If you input a vector of cash flows from a single cash flow stream, then irr returns
a scalar rate of return. If you input a matrix of cash flows from multiple cash flow streams, where
each matrix column represents a different stream, then irr returns a vector of internal rates of
return, where the columns correspond to the columns of the input matrix. Many other Financial
Toolbox functions work similarly.

As an example, suppose that you make an initial investment of $100, from which you then receive by
a series of annual cash receipts of $10, $20, $30, $40, and $50. This cash flow stream is stored in a
vector

CashFlows = [-100 10 20 30 40 50]'

CashFlows =
  -100
    10
    20
    30
    40
    50

Use the irr function to compute the internal rate of return of the cash flow stream.

Rate = irr(CashFlows)

Rate =

0.1201

For the single cash flow stream CashFlows, the function returns a scalar rate of return of 0.1201, or
12.01%.

Now, use the irr function to compute internal rates of return for multiple cash flow streams.

Rate = irr([CashFlows CashFlows CashFlows])
