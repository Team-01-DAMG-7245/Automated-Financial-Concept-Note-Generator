Input Arguments

Speed — Speed represents the parameter S
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Speed represents the parameter S, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify Speed as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean-reversion speeds (the
rate at which the state vector reverts to its long-run average Level).

As a deterministic function of time, when Speed is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Speed must produce an NVars-by-NVars matrix. If you specify Speed as a function of time and
state, it calculates the speed of mean reversion. This function must generate an NVars-by-NVars
matrix of reversion rates when called with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Level — Level represents the parameter L
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Level represents the parameter L, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify Level as an array, it must be an NVars-by-1 column vector of reversion levels.

As a deterministic function of time, when Level is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Level must produce an NVars-by-1 column vector. If you specify Level as a function of time
and state, it must generate an NVars-by-1 column vector of reversion levels when called with two
inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Alpha — Alpha represents the parameter D
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state
