More About

holidays

The holidays function is based on a modern five-day workweek.

This function contains all holidays and special nontrading days for the New York Stock Exchange
from January 1, 1885 to December 31, 2070.

Since the New York Stock Exchange was open on Saturdays before September 29, 1952, exact
closures from 1885 to 2070 include Saturday trading days. To capture these dates, use the function
nyseclosures. The results from holidays and nyseclosures are identical if the
WorkWeekFormat in nyseclosures is 'Modern'.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although holidays supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
