Define and Create Backtest Strategies

Multiperiod Brinson attribution expects fixed, regular time periods. In this case, the backtest strategy
rebalance schedules will match the Brinson periods. You can set the rebalance dates to be monthly
starting from January first.

% Rebalance on the first trading day of each month.
rebalance_schedule = datetime(2006,1,1):calmonths(1):datetime(2006,12,1);
for idx = 1:numel(rebalance_schedule)
    priceIdx = find(rebalance_schedule(idx) <= pricesTT.Dates,1,'first');
    rebalance_schedule(idx) = pricesTT.Dates(priceIdx);
end

The risk budgeting strategy needs historical data in order to set initial weights. You can use the first
month of price data as a warm-up period to set the initial weights. The backtest begins at the end of
the warm-up period.

% Use first month as warm-up period for the risk budgeting strategy.
start_date = rebalance_schedule(2);

% Get the first month of prices to initialize the risk budgeting strategy.
initial_prices = pricesTT(pricesTT.Dates <= start_date,:);

Brinson attribution measures portfolio manager performance against some benchmark. For this
example, use a simple equal-weighted strategy as the benchmark. This example examines the
performance of the following two strategies relative to this benchmark:

•
Equal Category — This strategy allocates resources equally per category, and then allocates equal
weights for stocks within each category.

•
Risk Budgeting — This strategy sets weights for stocks with the goal of minimizing each asset's
risk contribution.

Create a backtestStrategy object for the benchmark and the two candidate strategies. Define
each of these strategies to use the same rebalance schedule and assign the appropriate initial
weights.

% Define the Benchmark strategy.
benchmark = backtestStrategy('Benchmark',@equalWeightRebalanceFcn, ...
    'RebalanceFrequency',rebalance_schedule, ...
    'InitialWeights',computeEqualWeights(num_assets), ...
    'UserData',struct());

% Define the equal category strategy.
equalCategory = backtestStrategy('EqualCategory',@equalCategoryRebalanceFcn, ...
    'RebalanceFrequency',rebalance_schedule, ...
    'InitialWeights',computeEqualCategory(asset_categories), ...
    'UserData',struct('Categories',asset_categories));

% Define the risk budgeting strategy.
riskBudgeting = backtestStrategy('RiskBudgeting',@riskBudgetingRebalanceFcn, ...
    'RebalanceFrequency',rebalance_schedule, ...
    'InitialWeights',computeRiskBudgeting(initial_prices));
