t = datetime(2014,6,18) + calmonths(1:4)

t =

1×4 datetime array

18-Jul-2014   18-Aug-2014   18-Sep-2014   18-Oct-2014

Subtract the origin value. For example, the origin value can be the starting day of an experiment.

dt = t - datetime(2014,7,1)

dt =

1×4 duration array

408:00:00   1152:00:00   1896:00:00   2616:00:00

dt is a duration array. Convert dt to a double array of values in units of years, days, hours,
minutes, or seconds by using the years, days, hours, minutes, or seconds function, respectively.

x = hours(dt)

x =

408        1152        1896        2616

Pass the double array as the input to the log function.

y = log(x)

y =

6.0113    7.0493    7.5475    7.8694

Input Conversions with datenum

The datenum function is important for using Financial Toolbox software efficiently. datenum takes an
input date character vector in any of several formats, with 'dd-mmm-yyyy', 'mm/dd/yyyy', or
'dd-mmm-yyyy, hh:mm:ss.ss' formats being the most common. The input date character vector
can have up to six fields formed by letters and numbers separated by any other characters, such that:

•
The day field is an integer from 1 through 31.

•
The month field is either an integer from 1 through 12 or an alphabetical character vector with at
least three characters.

•
The year field is a nonnegative integer. If only two numbers are specified, then the year is
assumed to lie within the 100-year period centered on the current year. If the year is omitted, the
current year is the default.

•
The hours, minutes, and seconds fields are optional. They are integers separated by colons or
followed by 'am' or 'pm'.

For example, if the current year is 1999, then all these dates are equivalent:

'17-May-1999'
'17-May-99'
'17-may'
'May 17, 1999'
