More About

Upper and Lower Bounds

Upper and lower bounds in portfolio optimization are critical constraints that help define the limits of
asset allocation, ensuring that the resulting portfolio aligns with the investor's goals for risk
tolerance.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to obtain bounds for portfolio weights from portfolio objects.

[LowerBound, UpperBound] = obj.getBounds;
