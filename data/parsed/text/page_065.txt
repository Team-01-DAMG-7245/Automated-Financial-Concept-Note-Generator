Yield Conventions

There are two yield and time factor conventions that are used in the Financial Toolbox software –
these are determined by the input basis. Specifically, bases 0 to 7 are assumed to have semiannual
compounding, while bases 8 to 12 are assumed to have annual compounding regardless of the period
of the bond's coupon payments (including zero-coupon bonds). In addition, any yield-related
sensitivity (that is, duration and convexity), when quoted on a periodic basis, follows this same
convention. (See bndconvp, bndconvy, bnddurp, bnddury, and bndkrdur.)

Pricing Functions

This example shows how to compute the price of a bond with an odd first period using bndprice.

Assume that you have a bond with these characteristics:

Settle          = '11-Nov-1992';
Maturity        = '01-Mar-2005';
IssueDate       = '15-Oct-1992';
FirstCouponDate = '01-Mar-1993';
CouponRate      = 0.0785;
Yield           = 0.0625;

Allow coupon payment period (Period = 2), day-count basis (Basis = 0), and end-of-month rule
(EndMonthRule = 1) to assume the default values. Also, assume that there is no odd last coupon date
and that the face value of the bond is $100. Calling the function:

[Price, AccruedInt] = bndprice(Yield, CouponRate, Settle, ... 
Maturity, [], [], [], IssueDate, FirstCouponDate)

Price = 
113.5977

AccruedInt = 
0.5855

bndprice returns a price of $113.60 and accrued interest of $0.59.

Note, bndprice uses nonlinear formulas to compute the price of a security. For this reason, Financial
Toolbox™ software uses Newton's method when solving for an independent variable within a formula.

Yield Functions

This example shows how to use bndyield compute the yield of a bond that has odd first and last
periods and settlement in the first period.

Set up variables for settlement, maturity date, issue, first coupon, and a last coupon date.

Settle          = '12-Jan-2000';
Maturity        = '01-Oct-2001';
IssueDate       = '01-Jan-2000';
FirstCouponDate = '15-Jan-2000';
LastCouponDate  = '15-Apr-2000';
