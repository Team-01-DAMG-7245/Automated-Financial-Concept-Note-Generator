Converting from Running to Upfront

This example shows how to convert the market quotes to upfront quotes. A CDS market quote is
given in terms of a standard spread (usually 100 bp or 500 bp) and an upfront payment, or in terms of
an equivalent running or breakeven spread, with no upfront payment. The functions cdsbootstrap,
cdsspread, and cdsprice perform upfront to running or running to upfront conversions.

For example, to convert the market quotes to upfront quotes for a standard spread of 100 bp:

Settle = '17-Jul-2009';  % Valuation date for the CDS
MarketDates = datenum({'20-Sep-10','20-Sep-11','20-Sep-12','20-Sep-14', ...
'20-Sep-16'});
MarketSpreads = [140 175 210 265 310]';
MarketData = [MarketDates MarketSpreads];

ZeroDates = datenum({'17-Jan-10','17-Jul-10','17-Jul-11','17-Jul-12', ...
'17-Jul-13','17-Jul-14'});
ZeroRates = [1.35 1.43 1.9 2.47 2.936 3.311]'/100;
ZeroData = [ZeroDates ZeroRates];

[ProbData,HazData] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle);

Maturity3 = MarketData(:,1);
Spread3Run = MarketData(:,2);
Spread3Std = 100*ones(size(Maturity3));
Price3 = cdsprice(ZeroData,ProbData,Settle,Maturity3,Spread3Std);
Upfront3 = Price3/10000000; % Standard notional of 10MM
display(Upfront3);

Upfront3 = 5Ã—1

0.0047
    0.0158
    0.0327
    0.0737
    0.1182

The conversion can be reversed to convert upfront quotes to market quotes.

ProbData3Upf = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,[Maturity3 Upfront3 Spread3Std],Settle);
Spread3RunFromUpf = cdsspread(ZeroData,ProbData3Upf,Settle,Maturity3);
display([Spread3Run Spread3RunFromUpf]);

140.0000  140.0000
  175.0000  175.0000
  210.0000  210.0000
  265.0000  265.0000
  310.0000  310.0000

Comparing the results of this conversion to the original market spread demonstrates the reversal.

Under the flat-hazard rate (FHR) quoting convention, a single market quote is used to calibrate a
probability curve. This convention yields a single point in the probability curve, and a single hazard
rate value. For example, assume a four-year (standard dates) CDS contract with a current FHR-based
running spread of 550 bp needs conversion to a CDS contract with a standard spread of 500 bp.
