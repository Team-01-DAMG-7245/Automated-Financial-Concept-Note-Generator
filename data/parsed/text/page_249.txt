Working with 'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets, and
MaxNumAssets Constraints Using Portfolio Objects

When any one, or any combination of 'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets, or
MaxNumAssets constraints are active, the portfolio problem is formulated by adding NumAssets
binary variables, where 0 indicates not invested, and 1 is invested. For example, to explain the
'Conditional' BoundType and MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets constraints, assume that your
portfolio has a universe of 100 assets that you want to invest:

•
'Conditional' BoundType (also known as semicontinuous constraints), set by setBounds, is
often used in situations where you do not want to invest small values. A standard example is a
portfolio optimization problem where many small allocations are not attractive because of
transaction costs. Instead, you prefer fewer instruments in the portfolio with larger allocations.
This situation can be handled using'Conditional' BoundType constraints for a Portfolio,
PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object.

For example, the weight you invest in each asset is either 0 or between [0.01, 0.5]. Generally,
a semicontinuous variable x is a continuous variable between bounds [lb, ub] that also can
assume the value 0, where lb > 0, lb ≤ ub. Applying this to portfolio optimization requires that
very small or large positions should be avoided, that is values that fall in (0, lb) or are more than
ub.

•
MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets (also known as cardinality constraints), set by
setMinMaxNumAssets, limit the number of assets in a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD object. For example, if you have 100 assets in your portfolio and you want the
number of assets allocated in the portfolio to be from 40 through 60. Using MinNumAssets and
MaxNumAssets you can limit the number of assets in the optimized portfolio, which allows you to
limit transaction and operational costs or to create an index tracking portfolio.

Setting 'Conditional' BoundType Constraints Using the setBounds
Function

Use setBounds with a 'conditional' BoundType to set xi = 0 or 0.02 <= xi <= 0.5 for all
i=1,...NumAssets:

AssetMean = [ 0.0101110; 0.0043532; 0.0137058 ];
AssetCovar = [ 0.00324625 0.00022983 0.00420395;
               0.00022983 0.00049937 0.00019247;
               0.00420395 0.00019247 0.00764097 ]; p = Portfolio('AssetMean', AssetMean, 'AssetCo
p = setBounds(p, 0.02, 0.5,'BoundType', 'Conditional', 'NumAssets', 3)

p =
