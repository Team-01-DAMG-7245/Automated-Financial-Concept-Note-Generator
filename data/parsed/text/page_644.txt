Setting and Getting Properties

You can set properties of a PortfolioCVaR object using either the PortfolioCVaR object or
various set functions.

Note Although you can also set properties directly, it is not recommended since error-checking is not
performed when you set a property directly.

The PortfolioCVaR object supports setting properties with name-value pair arguments such that
each argument name is a property and each value is the value to assign to that property. For example,
to set the LowerBound, Budget, and ProbabilityLevel properties in an existing PortfolioCVaR
object p, use the syntax:

p = PortfolioCVaR(p,'LowerBound', 0, 'Budget', 1, 'ProbabilityLevel', 0.95);

In addition to the PortfolioCVaR object, which lets you set individual properties one at a time,
groups of properties are set in a PortfolioCVaR object with various “set” and “add” functions. For
example, to set up an average turnover constraint, use the setTurnover function to specify the
bound on portfolio turnover and the initial portfolio. To get individual properties from a
PortfolioCVaR object, obtain properties directly or use an assortment of “get” functions that obtain
groups of properties from a PortfolioCVaR object. The PortfolioCVaR object and set functions
have several useful features:

•
The PortfolioCVaR object and set functions try to determine the dimensions of your problem
with either explicit or implicit inputs.

•
The PortfolioCVaR object and set functions try to resolve ambiguities with default choices.

•
The PortfolioCVaR object and set functions perform scalar expansion on arrays when possible.

•
The CVaR functions try to diagnose and warn about problems.

Displaying PortfolioCVaR Objects

The PortfolioCVaR object uses the default display functions provided by MATLAB, where display
and disp display a PortfolioCVaR object and its properties with or without the object variable
name.

Saving and Loading PortfolioCVaR Objects

Save and load PortfolioCVaR objects using the MATLAB save and load commands.

Estimating Efficient Portfolios and Frontiers

Estimating efficient portfolios and efficient frontiers is the primary purpose of the CVaR portfolio
optimization tools. An efficient portfolio are the portfolios that satisfy the criteria of minimum risk for
a given level of return and maximum return for a given level of risk. A collection of “estimate” and
“plot” functions provide ways to explore the efficient frontier. The “estimate” functions obtain either
efficient portfolios or risk and return proxies to form efficient frontiers. At the portfolio level, a
collection of functions estimates efficient portfolios on the efficient frontier with functions to obtain
efficient portfolios:
