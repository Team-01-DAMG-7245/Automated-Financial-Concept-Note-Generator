Cluster Commodities Based on Similarity in Regular Component

The regular component is the sum of the long-term and seasonal trends Lt + St, and is equal to
Pt âˆ’Ct, the commodity price series without its irregular (business cycle) component.

Evaluate the pairwise distances and the corresponding linkage.

regularCorrDistances = pdist( regularComponent.', "correlation" );
regularComponentLinkage = linkage( regularCorrDistances, "complete" );

Create a dendrogram to visualize the linkage, and then select a threshold to achieve three clusters.
