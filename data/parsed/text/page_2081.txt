Data Types: single | double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer [0,1]

End-of-month rule flag for month having 30 or fewer days, specified as a nonnegative integer [0, 1]
using an N-by-1 vector of values. This rule applies only when Maturity is an end-of-month date for a
month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a bond’s coupon payment date is always the same numerical day of
the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a bond’s coupon payment date is always the last actual day of the
month.

Data Types: logical

IssueDate — Bond issue date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Bond issue date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors.

To support existing code, cpndaysn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

FirstCouponDate — Date when bond makes first coupon payment
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Date when a bond makes its first coupon payment, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

FirstCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular first coupon period. When
FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified, FirstCouponDate takes precedence
in determining the coupon payment structure. If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash
flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndaysn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Last coupon date of bond before maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector
