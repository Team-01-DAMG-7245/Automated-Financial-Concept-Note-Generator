Examples

Return the Future Value of a Series of Equal Payments

This example shows how to compute the future value of a series of equal payments using a savings
account that has a starting balance of $1500. $200 is added at the end of each month for 10 years
and the account pays 9% interest compounded monthly.

FutureVal = fvfix(0.09/12, 12*10, 200, 1500, 0)

FutureVal = 
4.2380e+04
