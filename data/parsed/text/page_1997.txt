Data Types: double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer 0 or 1

(Optional) End-of-month rule flag, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector.
This rule applies only when Maturity is an end-of-month date for a month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the same numerical day of
the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the last actual day of the
month.

Data Types: logical

IssueDate — Bond issue date
cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs (default) | datetime array | string array |
date character vector

(Optional) Bond Issue date, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS vector using
a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify an IssueDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cfdatesq also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

FirstCouponDate — Irregular or normal first coupon date
cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs (default) | datetime array | string array |
date character vector

Irregular or normal first coupon date, specified as a scalar or a NUMBONDS-by-1 or 1-by-NUMBONDS
vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs.

To support existing code, cfdatesq also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime
