addGroups

Add group constraints for portfolio weights to existing group constraints

Syntax

obj = addGroups(obj,GroupMatrix,LowerGroup)
obj = addGroups(obj,GroupMatrix,LowerGroup,UpperGroup)

Description

obj = addGroups(obj,GroupMatrix,LowerGroup) adds group constraints for portfolio weights
to existing group constraints for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD objects. For
details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

Given GroupMatrix and either LowerGroup or UpperGroup, a portfolio Port must satisfy the
following:

LowerGroup <= GroupMatrix * Port <= UpperGroup

obj = addGroups(obj,GroupMatrix,LowerGroup,UpperGroup) adds group constraints for
portfolio weights to existing group constraints with an additional option for UpperGroup.

Given GroupMatrix and either LowerGroup or UpperGroup, a portfolio Port must satisfy the
following:

LowerGroup <= GroupMatrix * Port <= UpperGroup

Examples

Add Group Constraints to a Portfolio Object

Set a group constraint to ensure that the first three assets constitute at most 30% of a portfolio. Then
add another group constraint to ensure that the odd-numbered assets constitute at least 20% of a
portfolio.

p = Portfolio;
G = [ true true true false false ];    % group matrix for first group constraint
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
G = [ true false true false true ];    % group matrix for second group constraint
p = addGroups(p, G, 0.2);
disp(p.NumAssets);

disp(p.GroupMatrix);
