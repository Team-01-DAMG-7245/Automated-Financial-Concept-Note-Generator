xt = ft −μ

and define the deflated yields yt∼ as

yt∼= yt −Λμ

then you can substitute xt and yt∼ into the preceding equations to obtain the following Diebold-Li state-
space system:

xt = Axt −1 + ηt

yt∼= Λxt + εt

Load Yield Curve Data and ssm Model

The yield data consists of 29 years of monthly, unsmoothed Fama-Bliss US Treasury zero-coupon yield
measurements. The time series in the data represents maturities of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36,
48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, and 120 months. The data expresses the yields in percents and records them
at the end of each month, beginning January 1972 and ending December 2000, for a total of 348
monthly curves of 17 maturities each.

Load the Diebold-Li data set and extract the yield series.

Simulate Bond Returns

To simulate bond returns for the following investment period (t + 1), follow these steps:

1
Price bonds at time period t by using the zero-coupon bond yield curve, also known as the zero
curve. Since some bonds have cash flows whose time to maturity do not match one of the tenors
in the zero curve, you must use interpolation.

2
Simulate the t + 1 zero curve by using the period t factor estimates and their covariance matrix.

3
Price bonds at time period t + 1 by using the simulated zero curves.

4
Compute simulated returns by using the following formula for each bond i:

Pi t + 1 −Pit

Pit

Start by loading the bonds information.

load('BondsCouponsAndMaturities')
couponRate = bondsTable.CouponRate;
bondsMaturity = bondsTable.Maturity;

Define the purchase date as the date at the end of the time horizon.

settle = DataTimeTable.Time(end);
