getGroupRatio

Obtain group ratio constraint arrays from portfolio object

Syntax

[GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio,UpperRatio] = getGroupRatio(obj)

Description

Use the getGroupRatio function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain group ratio constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[GroupA,GroupB,LowerRatio,UpperRatio] = getGroupRatio(obj) obtains equality
constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

Examples

Obtain Group Ratio Constraints for a Portfolio Object

Suppose you want to make sure that the ratio of financial to nonfinancial companies in your portfolios
never goes above 50%. Assume you have 6 assets with 3 financial companies (assets 1-3) and 3
nonfinancial companies (assets 4-6). After setting group ratio constraints, obtain the values for
GroupA, GroupB, LowerRatio, and UpperRatio.

GA = [ true true true false false false ];    % financial companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];    % nonfinancial companies
p = Portfolio;
p = setGroupRatio(p, GA, GB, [], 0.5);
[GroupA, GroupB, LowerRatio, UpperRatio] = getGroupRatio(p)

GroupA = 1×6

1     1     1     0     0     0

GroupB = 1×6

0     0     0     1     1     1

LowerRatio =

[]

UpperRatio = 
0.5000
