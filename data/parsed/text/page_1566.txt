Performance Fees

A performance fee, or incentive fee, is a periodic payment that is paid by fund investors based on the
fund's performance.

The performance fee can have a variety of structures, but it often is calculated as a percentage of a
fund's increase in NAV over some tracked high-water mark. This calculation ensures the fee is paid
only when the investment manager produces positive results. Performance fees in hedge funds are
sometimes set at 20%, meaning if the fund NAV goes from $1M to $1.2M, a fee of $40k would be
charged (20% of the $200k growth).

During the backtest, the backtest engine tracks a high-water mark. The high-water mark starts at the
portfolio initial value. At each performance fee date, if the portfolio value is greater than the previous
high-water mark, then the high-water mark is updated to the new portfolio value and the
performance fee is paid on the growth of the portfolio. The portfolio growth is the difference between
the new high-water mark and the previous one. If, on a performance fee date, the portfolio value is
less than the previous high-water mark, then no fee is paid and the high-water mark is not updated.

The high-water mark is typically updated at each performance fee date and does not track maximum
portfolio values between dates, as illustrated:
