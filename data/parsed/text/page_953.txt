The last backtesting tool is the use of prediction intervals. Linear regression models provide standard
formulas to compute confidence intervals for the values of new observations. These intervals are
shown in the next figure for the 10 years spanned in the backtesting exercise.

The observed default rates fall outside the prediction intervals for two years, 1996 and 1997, where
very low default rates are observed. For a 95% confidence level, two out of 10 seems high. Yet, the
observed values in these cases fall barely outside the prediction interval, which is a positive sign for
the model. It is also positive that the prediction intervals contain the observed values around the
2001 recession.

Stress Testing

Stress testing is a broad area that reaches far beyond computational tools; see, for example, [3 on
page 8-43]. This example shows some tools that you can incorporate into a comprehensive stress
testing framework. This example builds on the linear regression model presented above, but the
concepts and tools are compatible with other forecasting methodologies.

The first tool is the use of prediction intervals to define a worst-case scenario forecasts. This is to
account for uncertainty in the model only, not in the value of the predictors.
