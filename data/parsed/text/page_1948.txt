Input Arguments

ZeroData — Dates and zero rates
object from IRDataCurve or vector of dates and zero rates

Dates and zero rates, specified by an M-by-2 vector of dates, using a serial date number format, and
zero rates or the IRDataCurve object for zero rates. For more information on an IRDataCurve
object, see “Creating an IRDataCurve Object” (Financial Instruments Toolbox).

Data Types: object | double

ProbData — Dates and default probabilities
vector of dates and default probabilities

Dates and default probabilities, specified by a P-by-2 array, where dates use a serial date number
format.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Settlement date, specified by a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. This must be earlier
than or equal to the dates in Maturity.

To support existing code, cdsrpv01 also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — CDS maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector | serial date number

CDS maturity date, specified by an N-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. The CDS premium payment dates occur at regular intervals, and the last payment
occurs on these maturity dates.

To support existing code, cdsrpv01 also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: RPV01 =
cdsrpv01(ZeroData,ProbData,Settle,Maturity,'Period',1,'StartDate','20-
Sep-2010','Basis',1,
'BusinessDayConvention',actual,'CleanRPV01',true,'PayAccruedPremium',true,'Ze
roCompounding',1,'ZeroBasis',1)
