Algorithms

When you specify the input arguments Alpha and Sigma as MATLAB arrays, they are associated with
a specific parametric form. By contrast, when you specify either Alpha or Sigma as a function, you
can customize virtually any diffusion-rate specification.

Accessing the output diffusion-rate parameters Alpha and Sigma with no inputs simply returns the
original input specification. Thus, when you invoke diffusion-rate parameters with no inputs, they
behave like simple properties and allow you to test the data type (double vs. function, or equivalently,
static vs. dynamic) of the original input specification. This is useful for validating and designing
methods.

When you invoke diffusion-rate parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the
impression of dynamic behavior. The parameters Alpha and Sigma accept the observation time t and
a state vector Xt, and return an array of appropriate dimension. Specifically, parameters Alpha and
Sigma evaluate the corresponding diffusion-rate component. Even if you originally specified an input
as an array, diffusion treats it as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing
that all parameters are accessible by the same interface.
