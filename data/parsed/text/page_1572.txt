If RatesConvention is "PerStep", then the CashBorrowRate value is a decimal percentage and
represents the interest accrual rate for one time step in the backtest. For example, if the backtest is
using daily asset price data, then the CashBorrowRate value must be the daily interest rate for
negative cash balances.

Data Types: double | timetable

InitialPortfolioValue — Initial portfolio value
10000 (default) | numeric

Initial portfolio value, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'InitialPortfolioValue' and a scalar numeric.

Data Types: double

RatesConvention — Defines how backtest engine uses RiskFreeRate and CashBorrowRate
to compute interest
"Annualized" (default) | character vector with value 'Annualized' or 'PerStep' | string with
value "Annualized" or "PerStep"

Defines how backtest engine uses RiskFreeRate and CashBorrowRate to compute interest,
specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RatesConvention' and a character vector or
string.

•
'Annualized' — The rates are treated as annualized rates and the backtest engine computes
incremental interest based on the day count convention specified in the Basis property. This is
the default.

•
'PerStep' — The rates are treated as per-step rates and the backtest engine computes interest
at the provided rates at each step of the backtest.

Data Types: char | string

DateAdjustment — Date handling behavior for rebalance dates that are missing from asset
prices timetable
"Previous" (default) | character vector with value 'Previous', 'Next', or 'None' | string with
value "Previous", "Next", or "None"

Date handling behavior for rebalance dates that are missing from asset prices timetable, specified as
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'DateAdjustment' and a character vector or string.

•
'Previous' — For each rebalance date in the rebalance schedule, the rebalance occurs on the
nearest date in the asset timetable that occurs on or before the requested rebalance date. This is
the default.

•
'Next' — Move to the next date.

•
'None' — Dates are not adjusted and the backtest engine errors when encountering a rebalance
date that does not appear in the asset prices timetable.

Data Types: char | string

Basis — Defines day-count convention when computing interest at RiskFreeRate or
CashBorrowRate
0 (default) | numeric values: 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
