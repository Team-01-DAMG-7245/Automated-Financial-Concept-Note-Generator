More About

Credit Default Swap

A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial derivative contract that allows an investor to "swap" or
transfer the credit risk of a borrower (usually a corporation or government) to another party.

The parties involved are:

•
Protection Buyer — The party that purchases the CDS to protect against the risk of default. They
pay periodic premiums (known as the CDS spread) to the protection seller.

•
Protection Seller — The party that provides the credit protection and receives the premiums
from the protection buyer. In the event of a default, the protection seller is obligated to
compensate the protection buyer.

CDS Spread

The market, or breakeven, spread value of a CDS.

The CDS spread can be computed by equating the value of the protection leg with the value of the
premium leg:

Market Spread * RPV01 = Value of Protection Leg

The left side corresponds to the value of the premium leg, and this has been decomposed as the
product of the market or breakeven spread times the RPV01 or 'risky present value of a basis point' of
the contract. The latter is the present value of the premium payments, considering the default
probability. The Market Spread can be computed as the ratio of the value of the protection leg, to
the RPV01 of the contract. cdsspread returns the resulting spread in basis points.

Algorithms

The premium leg is computed as the product of a spread S and the risky present value of a basis point
(RPV01). The RPV01 is given by:

RPV01 = ∑
j = 1

Z(t j)Δ(t j −1, t j, B)Q(t j)
