busdate

Next or previous business day

Syntax

Busday = busdate(Date)
Busday = busdate( ___ ,DirFlag,Holiday,Weekend)

Description

Busday = busdate(Date) returns the scalar, vector, or matrix of the next or previous business
days, depending on the definition for Holiday.

Busday = busdate( ___ ,DirFlag,Holiday,Weekend) returns the scalar, vector, or matrix of
the next or previous business days, depending on the optional input arguments, including Holiday.

If both Date and Holiday are either strings or date character vectors, Busday is returned as a serial
date number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime
arrays.

However, if either Date or Holiday are datetime arrays, Busday is returned as a datetime array.

Examples

Busday = busdate('3-Jul-2001', 1)

Busday =

datestr(Busday)

ans = 
'05-Jul-2001'

Indicate that Saturday is a business day by appropriately setting the Weekend argument. July 4, 2003
falls on a Friday. Use busdate to verify that Saturday, July 5, is actually a business day.

Weekend = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0];
Date = datestr(busdate('3-Jul-2003', 1, [], Weekend))

Date = 
'05-Jul-2003'

If either Date or Holiday are datetime arrays, Busday is returned as a datetime array.
