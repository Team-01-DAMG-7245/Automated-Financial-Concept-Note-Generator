Diffusion-rate model component

Description

The diffusion object specifies the diffusion-rate component of continuous-time stochastic
differential equations (SDEs).

The diffusion-rate specification supports the simulation of sample paths of NVars state variables
driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods,
approximating continuous-time stochastic processes.

The diffusion-rate specification can be any NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued function G of the
general form:

G(t, Xt) = D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)
 (15-1)

where:

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix-valued function.

•
Each diagonal element of D is the corresponding element of the state vector raised to the
corresponding element of an exponent Alpha, which is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued function.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued volatility rate function Sigma.

•
Alpha and Sigma are also accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

And a diffusion-rate specification is associated with a vector-valued SDE of the form:

dXt = F(t, Xt)dt + G(t, Xt)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, in which each element along the main diagonal is the
corresponding element of the state vector raised to the corresponding power of α.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued volatility rate function Sigma.

The diffusion-rate specification is flexible, and provides direct parametric support for static
volatilities and state vector exponents. It is also extensible, and provides indirect support for
dynamic/nonlinear models via an interface. This enables you to specify virtually any diffusion-rate
specification.
