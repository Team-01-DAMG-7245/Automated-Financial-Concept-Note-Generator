Defines the day-count convention when computing interest at the RiskFreeRate or
CashBorrowRate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Basis' and a scalar integer
using a supported value:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note Basis is only used when the RatesConvention property is set to "Annualized". If the
RatesConvention is "PerStep", and Basis is set, backtestEngine ignores the Basis value.

Data Types: double

PayExpensesFromCash — Indicates if transaction expenses paid from cash account or by
reducing portfolio value
false (default) | true or false

Indicates if backtest expenses (transaction costs or fees) are paid from cash account or by reducing
the total portfolio value, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'PayExpensesFromCash' and a logical value.

If set to false (the default), backtest expenses are paid by reducing the total portfolio value. This
allows the backtest engine to pay for expenses while maintaining the strategy allocation weights
exactly.

If set to true, the backtest engine pays all expenses from one or more cash accounts (CashAssets)
or debt accounts (DebtAssets). This happens as follows:

1
If user-controlled cash assets are not specified (that is, the CashAssets or DebtAssets
parameters for runBacktest are not set), then expenses are paid from the unallocated cash
account. This is the default behavior. The unallocated cash account contains the remaining
portfolio value when the backtestStrategy rebalance function returns portfolio weights that
do not sum to 1. Unallocated cash earns the RiskFreeRate (or CashBorrowRate if it goes
negative).
