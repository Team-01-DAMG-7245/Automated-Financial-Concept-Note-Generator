Input Arguments

ZeroData — Zero rate data
vector | IRDataCurve object

Zero rate data, specified as a M-by-2 vector of dates, using a serial date number format, and zero
rates or an IRDataCurve object of zero rates.

When ZeroData is an IRDataCurve object, ZeroCompounding and ZeroBasis are implicit in
ZeroData and are redundant inside this function. In this case, specify these optional parameters
when constructing the IRDataCurve object before using the cdsprice function.

For more information on an IRDataCurve object, see “Creating an IRDataCurve Object” (Financial
Instruments Toolbox).

Data Types: double | object

ProbData — Default probability values
matrix

Default probability values, specified as a P-by-2 matrix with dates, using a serial date number format,
and the corresponding cumulative default probability values.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. The Settle date
must be earlier than or equal to the dates in Maturity.

To support existing code, cdsprice also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date, specified as a N-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors.

To support existing code, cdsprice also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

ContractSpread — Contract spreads
numeric

Contract spreads, specified as a N-by-1 vector of spreads, expressed in basis points.

Data Types: double
