Dates — Simulation dates corresponding to each row of the values array
vector of date numbers | cell array of character vectors

Simulation dates corresponding to each row of the values array, specified as a NUMDATES-by-1
vector of simulation dates. Dates is either a vector of MATLAB date numbers or else a cell array of
character vectors in a known date format.

Note When computing collateralized exposures, both the CollateralTable parameter and the
Dates parameter must be specified.

Data Types: double | cell

Output Arguments

exposures — 3-D array of credit exposures
array

3-D array of credit exposures representing the potential losses from each counterparty or contract at
each date and over all scenarios. The size of exposures depends on the ExposureType input
argument:

•
When ExposureType is 'Counterparty', exposures returns a NumDates-by-
NumCounterparties-by-NumScenarios “cube” of credit exposures representing potential losses
that could be incurred over all dates, counterparties, and scenarios, if a counterparty defaulted
(ignoring any post-default recovery).

•
When ExposureType is 'Additive', exposures returns a NumDates-by-NumContracts-by-
NumScenarios “cube,” where each element is the additive exposure of each contract (over all
dates and scenarios). Additive exposures sum to the counterparty-level exposure.

exposurecpty — Counterparties that correspond to columns of exposures array
vector

Counterparties that correspond to columns of the exposures array, returned as
NumCounterparties or NumContracts elements depending on the ExposureType.

collateral — Simulated collateral amounts available to counterparties at each simulation
date and over each scenario
3D array

Simulated collateral amounts available to counterparties at each simulation date and over each
scenario, returned as a NumDates-by-NumCounterparties-by-NumScenarios 3D array. Collateral
amounts are calculated using a Brownian bridge to estimate contract values between simulation
dates. For more information, see “Brownian Bridge” on page 15-658. If the CollateralTable was
not specified, this output is empty.

More About

Counterparty Credit Exposure

Counterparty credit exposure refers to the risk that a counterparty in a financial transaction may
default on its obligations, leading to potential financial losses for the other party involved in the
transaction.
