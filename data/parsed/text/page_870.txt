% Compute risk and returns of the portfolios on the efficient frontier
rsk = estimatePortRisk(p,pwgt);
ret = estimatePortReturn(p,pwgt);

Plot the weights from the frontier estimation with plotFrontier. The resulting curve is piece-wise
concave with possible vertical jumps (discontinuities) between the concave intervals.

Changing MINLP Solvers

In the previous section, you use the default solver for estimateFrontier. However, you can solve
mixed-integer portfolio problems using any of these three three algorithms supported by
setSolverMINLP: OuterApproximation, ExtendedCP, and TrustRegionCP. Furthermore, the
OuterApproximation algorithm accepts an additional name-value argument
(ExtendedFormulation) for Portfolio problems, which reformulates problems with quadratic
functions to work in an extended space that usually decreases the computation time. All algorithms,
including the extended formulation variation of the OuterApproximation algorithm, return the
same values within numerical accuracy. The available solvers are:

•
OuterApproximation — The default algorithm, which is robust and usually faster than
ExtenedCP

•
OuterApproximation with ExtendedFormulation set to true — A robust algorithm that is
usually faster than other algorithms, but supported only for Portfolio object problems

•
ExtendedCP — The most robust solver, but usually the slowest

•
TrustRegionCP — The fastest algorithm, but one that is less robust and may provide suboptimal
solutions
