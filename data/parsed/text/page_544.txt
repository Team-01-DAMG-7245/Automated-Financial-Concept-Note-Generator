At t = 4, the wealth goal has been achieved. However, because of the uncertainty in the problem, the
probability of success is not yet 1. Furthermore, trying different paths (random seeds) shows how
even a monotonic increase in the wealth does not translate to a monotonic increase in the probability
of success. This behavior occurs because the wealth increase at later time periods should be higher
than at earlier time periods to have the same increase in the probability of success.

Plot the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of attaining the goal wealth at different time periods.
