ecmnobj

Multivariate normal negative log-likelihood function

Syntax

Objective = ecmnobj(Data,Mean,Covariance)
Objective = ecmnobj( ___ ,CholCovariance)

Description

Objective = ecmnobj(Data,Mean,Covariance) evaluates the negative log-likelihood function
for ecmnmle.

Use ecmnobj after estimating the mean and covariance of Data with ecmnmle.

Objective = ecmnobj( ___ ,CholCovariance) adds an optional argument for
CholCovariance.

Examples

Compute Value of the Observed Negative Log-Likelihood Function for Data

This example shows how to compute the value of the observed negative log-likelihood function for
five years of daily total return data for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and six
software companies

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

[ECMMean, ECMCovar] = ecmnmle(Data)

ECMMean = 12×1
