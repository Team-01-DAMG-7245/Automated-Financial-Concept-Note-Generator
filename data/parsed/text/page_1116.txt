Term Structure Analysis and Interest-Rate Swaps

This example shows how to derive implied zero and forward curves from the observed market prices
of coupon-bearing bonds.

This code illustrates some of the term-structure analysis functions found in Financial Toolbox™
software. Specifically, it illustrates how to derive implied zero (spot) and forward curves from the
observed market prices of coupon-bearing bonds. The zero and forward curves implied from the
market data are then used to price an interest rate swap agreement.

In an interest rate swap, two parties agree to a periodic exchange of cash flows. One of the cash flows
is based on a fixed interest rate held constant throughout the life of the swap. The other cash flow
stream is tied to some variable index rate. Pricing a swap at inception amounts to finding the fixed
rate of the swap agreement. This fixed rate, appropriately scaled by the notional principal of the swap
agreement, determines the periodic sequence of fixed cash flows.

In general, interest rate swaps are priced from the forward curve such that the variable cash flows
implied from the series of forward rates and the periodic sequence of fixed-rate cash flows have the
same current value. Thus, interest rate swap pricing and term structure analysis are intimately
related.

Define Data

Specify values for the settlement date, maturity dates, coupon rates, and market prices for 10 U.S.
Treasury Bonds. This data allows you to price a five-year swap with net cash flow payments
exchanged every six months. For simplicity, accept default values for the end-of-month payment rule
(rule in effect) and day-count basis (actual/actual). To avoid issues of accrued interest, assume that all
Treasury Bonds pay semiannual coupons and that settlement occurs on a coupon payment date.

Settle   = datenum('15-Jan-1999');

BondData = {'15-Jul-1999'  0.06000   99.93
            '15-Jan-2000'  0.06125   99.72
            '15-Jul-2000'  0.06375   99.70
            '15-Jan-2001'  0.06500   99.40
            '15-Jul-2001'  0.06875   99.73
            '15-Jan-2002'  0.07000   99.42
            '15-Jul-2002'  0.07250   99.32
            '15-Jan-2003'  0.07375   98.45
            '15-Jul-2003'  0.07500   97.71
            '15-Jan-2004'  0.08000   98.15};

BondData is an instance of a MATLAB® cell array, indicated by the curly braces ({}).

Next assign the date stored in the cell array to Maturity, CouponRate, and Prices vectors for
further processing.

Maturity   = datenum(char(BondData{:,1}));
CouponRate = [BondData{:,2}]';
Prices     = [BondData{:,3}]';
Period     = 2; % semiannual coupons

Bootstrap Zero Curve

Now that the data has been specified, use the term structure function zbtprice to bootstrap the
zero curve implied from the prices of the coupon-bearing bonds. This implied zero curve represents
