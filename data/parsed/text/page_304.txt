Portfolio Objects on page 4-9, Supported Constraints for Portfolio Optimization Using PortfolioCVaR
Object on page 5-8, and Supported Constraints for Portfolio Optimization Using PortfolioMAD
Object on page 6-8. For all other risk measures and constraints and if tracking error is in the
objective, use the Optimization Toolbox.

The advantage of the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, and PortfolioMAD object framework over the
problem-based framework for the type of problems in the "preferred" case is that common portfolio
optimization workflows are leveraged. For example, the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, and
PortfolioMAD object framework supports the following workflows:

•
Estimating and plotting the efficient frontier

•
Exchanging the return and risk proxies from the objective function to a constraint

•
Solving the maximum Sharpe ratio problem

•
Adding bounds on the number of assets selected

•
Adding semicontinuous bounds

•
Simplifying the use of turnover constraints and sell or buy costs

Use Optimization Toolbox

The two general cases to use Optimization Toolbox is:

•
Problems that have nonlinear constraints other than the constraints for risk or tracking error
