Single Period Goal-Based Wealth Management

This example shows a method for goal-based wealth management (GBWM). In GBWM, risk is not
necessarily measured using the standard deviation, the value-at-risk, or any other common risk
measure. Instead, risk is understood as the likelihood of not attaining an investor's goal. You choose a
weight allocation that is on the traditional mean-variance efficient frontier and that also maximizes
the probability of exceeding a wealth goal at the end of the investment horizon. In other words, you
choose the portfolio on the efficient frontier that minimizes the risk of not attaining the investor's
goal.

A common issue after computing the mean-variance efficient frontier is how to choose a single
portfolio to invest in. This portfolio could be the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio, which selects the
weights that achieve the highest return given the amount of risk taken. However, choosing this
portfolio does not take the investor's preferences into account. Another way strategy is to gauge the
risk preference of the investor and select a portfolio that achieves a risk no larger than the investor's
preferred risk. However, it is difficult to quantify the risk aversion of an investor. In this example, you
use the probability of achieving a wealth goal to help choose a portfolio on the efficient frontier.

Load Data

Load the data and then annualize the asset returns and the variance-covariance matrix.

% Load data
load BlueChipStockMoments.mat
AssetMean = 12*AssetMean;
AssetCovar = 12*AssetCovar;

Plot Efficient Frontier

Use Portfolio to create a Portfolio object and estimateMaxSharpeRatio to compute the
maximum Sharpe ratio. Then, use plotFrontier to plot the efficient frontier for long-only, fully-
invested portfolios and mark the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio.

% Create a Portfolio object.
p = Portfolio(AssetList=AssetList,AssetMean=AssetMean,...
    AssetCovar=AssetCovar);

% Add long-only, fully-invested constraints
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

% Compute the maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio.
wSR = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p);

% Plot the efficient frontier.
numPorts = 20;
figure;
[pret,prisk] = plotFrontier(p,20);
hold on
plot(estimatePortRisk(p,wSR),estimatePortReturn(p,wSR),'b.',...
    'MarkerSize',20);
legend('Efficient frontier','Max Sharpe Ratio',...
    'Location','southeast')
hold off
