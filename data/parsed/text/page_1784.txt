blkimpv

Implied volatility for futures options from Black model

Syntax

Volatility = blkimpv(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Value)
Volatility = blkimpv( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Volatility = blkimpv(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Value) computes the implied volatility of a
futures price from the market value of European futures options using Black's model. If the Class
name-value argument is empty or unspecified, the default is a call option

Note Any input argument can be a scalar, vector, or matrix. When a value is a scalar, that value is
used to compute the implied volatility of all the options. If more than one input is a vector or matrix,
the dimensions of all nonscalar inputs must be identical.

Ensure that Rate and Time are expressed in consistent units of time.

Volatility = blkimpv( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more name-value pair
arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Find Implied Volatility for Futures Options from Black's Model

This example shows how to find the implied volatility for a European call futures option that expires
in four months, trades at $1.1166, and has an exercise price of $20. Assume that the current
underlying futures price is also $20 and that the risk-free rate is 9% per annum. Furthermore,
assume that you are interested in implied volatilities no greater than 0.5 (50% per annum). Under
these conditions, the following commands all return an implied volatility of 0.25, or 25% per annum.

Volatility = blkimpv(20, 20, 0.09, 4/12, 1.1166, 'Limit',0.5);
Volatility = blkimpv(20, 20, 0.09, 4/12, 1.1166, 'Limit',0.5,'Class',{'Call'});
Volatility = blkimpv(20, 20, 0.09, 4/12, 1.1166, 'Limit',0.5,'Class',true);
Volatility = blkimpv(20, 20, 0.09, 4/12, 1.1166, 'Limit',0.5,'Class',true,'Method','jackel2016')

Volatility = 
0.2500
