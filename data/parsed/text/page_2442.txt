kagi accepts Data input as a matrix, timetable, or table.

The syntax for kagi has changed. Previously, when using table input, the first column of dates could
be serial date numbers, date character vectors, or datetime arrays, and you were required to have
specific number of columns.

When using table input, the new syntax for kagi supports:

•
No need for time information. If you want to pass in date information, use timetable input.

•
No requirement of specific number of columns. However, you must provide valid column names.
kagi must contain a column named ‘price’ (case insensitive).
