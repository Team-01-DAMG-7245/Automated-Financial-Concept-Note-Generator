•
Alpha and Sigma are also accessible using the (t, Xt) interface.

The displayed parameters for a diffusion object are:

•
Rate: The diffusion-rate function, G(t,Xt).

•
Alpha: The state vector exponent, which determines the format of D(t,Xt) of G(t,Xt).

•
Sigma: The volatility rate, V(t,Xt), of G(t,Xt).

Alpha and Sigma enable you to query the original inputs. (The combined effect of the individual
Alpha and Sigma parameters is fully encapsulated by the function stored in Rate.) The Rate
functions are the calculation engines for the drift and diffusion objects, and are the only
parameters required for simulation.

Note You can express drift and diffusion classes in the most general form to emphasize the
functional (t, Xt) interface. However, you can specify the components A and B as functions that adhere
to the common (t, Xt) interface, or as MATLAB arrays of appropriate dimension.

Example: G = diffusion(1, 0.3) % Diffusion rate function G(t,X)

Examples

Create an SDE Object

Construct an SDE object obj to represent a univariate geometric Brownian Motion model of the form:
dXt = 0 . 1Xtdt + 0 . 3XtdWt.

Create drift and diffusion functions that are accessible by the common (t, Xt) interface:

F = @(t,X) 0.1 * X;
G = @(t,X) 0.3 * X;

Pass the functions to sde to create an object (obj) of class sde:

obj = sde(F, G)    % dX = F(t,X)dt + G(t,X)dW

obj =
