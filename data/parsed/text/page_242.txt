Notice that addGroupRatio determines which bounds are unbounded so you only need to focus on
the constraints you want to set.

The Portfolio object, setGroupRatio, and addGroupRatio implement scalar expansion on either
the LowerRatio or UpperRatio properties based on the dimension of the group matrices in GroupA
and GroupB properties.
