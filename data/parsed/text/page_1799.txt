Yield — Annualized continuously compounded yield of underlying asset over life of the
option
0 (default) | decimal

Annualized continuously compounded yield of the underlying asset over the life of the
option,specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Yield' and a decimal number. If Yield
is empty or missing, the default value is 0.

For example, for options written on stock indices, Yield could represent the dividend yield. For
currency options, Yield could be the foreign risk-free interest rate.

Note blsimpv can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

Data Types: double

Tolerance — Implied volatility termination tolerance
1e6 (default) | positive scalar numeric

Implied volatility termination tolerance, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'Tolerance' and a positive scalar numeric. If empty or missing, the default is 1e6.

Note If you are using Method with a value of 'jackel2016', the Tolerance argument is ignored.

Data Types: double

Class — Option class from which implied volatility is derived
true (call option) (default) | logical | cell array of character vectors | string array

Option class indicating option type (call or put) from which implied volatility is derived, specified as
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Class' and a logical indicator, cell array of character
vectors, or string array.

To specify call options, set Class = true or Class = {'call'}. To specify put options, set Class =
false or Class = {'put'} or Class = ["put"]. If Class is empty or unspecified, the default is a
call option.

Data Types: logical | cell | string

Method — Method for computing implied volatility
'jackel2016' (default) | character vector with values 'search' or 'jackel2016' | string with
values "search" or "jackel2016"
