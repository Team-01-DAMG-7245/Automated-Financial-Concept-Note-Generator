Build Signal Table

In addition to the historical adjusted asset prices, the backtesting framework allows you to optionally
specify signal data when running a backtest. Specify the signal data in a similar way as the prices by
using a MATLAB® timetable. The "time" dimension of the signal timetable must match that of the
prices timetable — that is, the rows of each table must have matching datetime values for the Time
column.

This example builds a signal timetable to support each of the three investment strategies:

•
Simple moving average crossover (SMA) strategy

•
Moving Average Convergence / Divergence (MACD) strategy

•
Relative Strength Index (RSI) strategy

Each strategy has a timetable of signals that are precomputed. Before you run the backtest, you
merge the three separate signal timetables into a single aggregate signal timetable to use for the
backtest.
