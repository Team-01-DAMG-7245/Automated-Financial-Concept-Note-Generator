Simulate Equity Markets Using GBM Simulation Methods

Consider simulation using GBM simulation methods. Separable GBM models have two specific
simulation methods:

•
An overloaded Euler simulation method, simByEuler, designed for optimal performance

•
A function, simBySolution, provides an approximate solution of the underlying stochastic
differential equation, designed for accuracy

Load the Data_GlobalIdx2 data set from the matlabroot/examples/finance/data directory and
use sde to specify the SDE model as in “Represent Market Models Using SDE Models” on page 14-
31, and the GBM model as in “Represent Market Models Using SDELD, CEV, and GBM Objects” on
page 14-33.

load Data_GlobalIdx2
prices  = [Dataset.TSX Dataset.CAC Dataset.DAX ...
    Dataset.NIK Dataset.FTSE Dataset.SP];

returns =  tick2ret(prices);

nVariables  = size(returns,2);
expReturn   = mean(returns);
sigma       = std(returns);
correlation = corrcoef(returns);
t           = 0;
X           = 100;
