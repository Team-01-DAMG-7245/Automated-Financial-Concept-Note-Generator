Average Turnover Constraints

Turnover constraint is a linear absolute value constraint that ensures estimated optimal portfolios
differ from an initial portfolio by no more than a specified amount. Although portfolio turnover is
defined in many ways, the turnover constraints implemented in Financial Toolbox compute portfolio
turnover as the average of purchases and sales. Use setTurnover to set average turnover
constraints. Average turnover constraints take the form

1
21T x −x0
≤τ

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

1 is the vector of ones (n vector).

x0 is the initial portfolio (n vector).

τ is the upper bound for turnover (scalar).

n is the number of assets in the universe.

Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, and PortfolioMAD object properties to specify the average turnover
constraint are:

•
Turnover for τ

•
InitPort for x0
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore this constraint.

One-Way Turnover Constraints

One-way turnover constraints ensure that estimated optimal portfolios differ from an initial portfolio
by no more than specified amounts according to whether the differences are purchases or sales. Use
setOneWayTurnover to set one-way turnover constraints. The constraints take the forms

1Tmax 0, x −x0
≤τB

1Tmax 0, x0 −x
≤τS
