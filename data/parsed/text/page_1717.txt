where:

•
X is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables (for example, short rates or equity prices) to
simulate.

•
W is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
F is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued drift-rate function.

•
G is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued diffusion-rate function.

Version History
Introduced in R2008a

R2023b: Added "milstein2" value to Scheme name-value argument
Behavior changed in R2023b

When the MDL input argument is a sdeddo, sdeld, sdemrd, bm, cev, gbm, merton, hwv, cir,
heston, or bates object, you can use a Scheme value of "milstein2".

Use the simByMilstein method to approximate a numerical solution of a stochastic differential
equation.

R2023a: Added "milstein" value to Scheme name-value argument
Behavior changed in R2023a

When the MDL input argument is a sdeddo, sdeld, sdemrd, bm, cev, gbm, merton, hwv, cir,
heston, or bates object, you can use a Scheme value of "milstein".

Use the simByMilstein method to approximate a numerical solution of a stochastic differential
equation.

R2022b: Approximation scheme to simulate the sample paths
Behavior changed in R2022b

When you specify Scheme, the MDL simulation method using the corresponding scheme is used
instead of the one defined in the MDL.Simulation property.
