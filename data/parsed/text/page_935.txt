Work with Nonsquare Matrices

This example shows how to work with group totals in a nonsquare matrix.

Transition probabilities and the number of transitions between ratings are usually reported without
the 'D' ('Default') row. For example, a credit report can contain the following table, indicating the
number of issuers starting in each rating (first column), and the number of transitions between
ratings (remaining columns):

Initial AAA AA A BBB BB B CCC D

AAA 98 88 9 1 0 0 0 0 0

AA 389 0 368 19 2 0 0 0 0

A 1165 1 21 1087 56 0 0 0 0

BBB 1435 0 2 89 1289 45 8 0 2

BB 915 0 0 1 60 776 73 2 3

B 867 0 0 1 7 88 715 39 17

CCC 112 0 0 0 1 3 34 61 13

You can store the information in this table in a totals structure compatible with the cohort
algorithm. For more information on the cohort algorithm and the totals structure, see transprob.
The totalsMat field is a nonsquare array in this case.

% Define totals structure
totals.totalsVec = [98 389 1165 1435 915 867 112];
totals.totalsMat = [
   88    9    1    0    0    0    0    0;
    0  368   19    2    0    0    0    0;
    1   21 1087   56    0    0    0    0;
    0    2   89 1289   45    8    0    2;
    0    0    1   60  776   73    2    3;
    0    0    1    7   88  715   39   17;
    0    0    0    1    3   34   61   13];
totals.algorithm = 'cohort';

transprobbytotals and transprobgrouptotals accept totals inputs with nonsquare
totalsMat fields. To get the transition matrix corresponding to the previous table, and to group
ratings into investment and speculative grade with the corresponding matrix:

transMat = transprobbytotals(totals)

transMat = 7Ã—8

89.7959    9.1837    1.0204         0         0         0         0         0
         0   94.6015    4.8843    0.5141         0         0         0         0
