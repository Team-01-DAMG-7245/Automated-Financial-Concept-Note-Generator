PortfolioMAD with
active
'Conditional'
BoundType,
MinNumAssets,
MaxNumAssets, or
conditional budget
constraints

estimateFronti
erByReturn

The problem is
formulated by
introducing
NumAssets binary
variables to
indicate whether
the corresponding
asset is invested or
not. Therefore, it
requires a mixed
integer nonlinear
programming
solver. Three types
of MINLP solvers
are offered, see
setSolverMINLP.

Mixed integer
nonlinear
programming
solver (MINLP)
using
setSolverMINLP

'fmincon' is used
when the
estimate
functions reduce
the problem into
NLP. This solver is
configured through
setSolver
