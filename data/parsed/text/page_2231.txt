Notice that the weights of the minimum tracking portfolio tries to keep the weights of the assets
more evenly weighted. However, in order to satisfy the risk constraint, the minimum tracking error
portfolio still allocates a larger weight to the less risky asset.

Input Arguments

obj — Object for portfolio optimization
Portfolio object

Object for portfolio optimization, specified using a Portfolio object. When using a Portfolio
object in the custom objective workflow, you do not need to specify both the mean and covariance.
However, the custom objective workflow requires that you specify either the mean, the covariance, or
the number of assets.

Note If no initial portfolio is specified in obj.InitPort, the initial portfolio is assumed to be 0 so
that pbuy = max(0, pwgt) and psell = max(0, -pwgt). If no tracking portfolio is specified in
obj.TrackingPort, the tracking portfolio is assumed to be 0.

Data Types: object

fun — Function handle that defines objective function
function handle

Function handle that defines the objective function, specified using a function handle in terms of the
portfolio weights.

Note The objective function must be continuous and defined using only the portfolio weights as
variables. If the portfolio problem has cardinality constraints and/or conditional bounds using
