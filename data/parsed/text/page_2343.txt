FanFaceColor — Color of each fan
[1 1 0;1 0 0] (yellow to red) (default) | matrix

Color of each fan, specified as an N-by-3 matrix controlling the color of each fan, where each row is
an RGB triplet. There are three possible values of N:

•
When N = NumQuantiles, the color of each fan is specified by the corresponding row in the
matrix.

•
When N = ceil(NumQuantiles/2), the specified colors represent the bottom half of the fans. The
colors of the top half are determined by reversing the order of these colors. For more information,
see ceil.

•
When N = 2, the colors in the bottom half of the fan are a linear interpolation between the two
specified colors. The pattern is reversed for the top half.

HistoricalMarker — Marker symbol of historical line
'o' (default) | character vector

HistoricalMarkerFaceColor — Marker fill color of historical line
axes dependent (default) | character vector with a value of 'none', 'auto', color identifier, or RGB
triplet

Marker fill color of historical line, specified as a character vector with a value of 'none', 'auto', a
character vector for color, or an RGB triplet. For more information on supported character vectors for
