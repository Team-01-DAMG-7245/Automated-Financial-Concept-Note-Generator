Use simByEuler to simulate NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The
function simByEuler approximates a continuous-time stochastic process by the Euler approach.

NPeriods = 2;
[Paths,Times,Z] = simByEuler(roughhestonObj,NPeriods)

Paths is a 3-by-2 matrix and the output Z is a matrix used to generate the Brownian motion vector.

Input Arguments

MDL — Stochastic differential equation model for RVM, roughbergomi, or roughheston
object

Stochastic differential equation model, specified as an rvm, roughbergomi, or roughheston object.

Data Types: object

NPeriods — Number of simulation periods
positive scalar integer

Number of simulation periods, specified as a positive scalar integer. The value of NPeriods
