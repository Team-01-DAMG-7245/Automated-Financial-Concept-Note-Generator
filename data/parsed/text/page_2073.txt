Previous quasi coupon date for a portfolio of NUMBONDS fixed income securities, whether or not the
first or last coupon is normal, short, or long, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of previous quasi-
coupon dates before settlement. If settlement is a coupon date, this function returns the settlement
date.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then PreviousQuasiCouponDate is returned as a serial
date number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted date character
vectors.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then PreviousQuasiCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.

More About

Quasi-Coupon

A quasi-coupon is a term used in the context of certain fixed-income securities, particularly bonds,
that do not pay traditional periodic interest payments (coupons) but instead provide returns in a
different manner.

A quasi coupon can include returns that are contingent on certain conditions or linked to the
performance of an underlying asset.

Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cpndatepq supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
