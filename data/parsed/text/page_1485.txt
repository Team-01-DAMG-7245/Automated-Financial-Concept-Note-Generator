sdeld objects provide a parametric alternative to the mean-reverting drift form and also provide an
alternative interface to the sdeddo parent class, because you can create an object without first
having to create its drift and diffusion-rate components.

Instance Hierarchy

There are inheritance relationships among the SDE classes.

The following figure illustrates the inheritance relationships.

For more information, see “SDE Models” on page 14-7, “SDE Classes and Associated Simulation
Methods” on page 14-13, and “SDE Class Hierarchy” on page 14-5.

Algorithms

When you specify the required input parameters as arrays, they are associated with a specific
parametric form. By contrast, when you specify either required input parameter as a function, you
can customize virtually any specification.
