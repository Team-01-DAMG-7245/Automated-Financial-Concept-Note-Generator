days360isda

Days between dates based on 360-day year (International Swap Dealer Association (ISDA) compliant)

Syntax

NumDays = days360isda(StartDate,EndDate)

Description

NumDays = days360isda(StartDate,EndDate) returns the number of days between StartDate
and EndDate based on a 360-day year (that is, all months contain 30 days) and is International Swap
Dealer Association (ISDA) compliant. If EndDate is earlier than StartDate, NumDays is negative.
Under this convention, all months contain 30 days.

Either input argument can contain multiple values, but if so, the other must contain the same number
of values or a single value that applies to all. For example, if StartDate is an n-row datetime, then
EndDate must be an N-by-1 vector of integers or a single integer. NumDays is then an N-by-1 vector of
date numbers.

Examples

Determine the Number of Days Between Two Dates Given a Basis of 30/360 Based on ISDA
Compliance

Determine the NumDays using date character vectors for StartDate and EndDate for the month of
January.

StartDate = '1-Jan-2002';
EndDate = '1-Feb-2002';
NumDays = days360isda(StartDate, EndDate)

NumDays = 
30

Determine the NumDays in the month of January using datetimes for StartDate and EndDate.

NumDays = days360isda(datetime(2002,1,1), datetime(2002,2,1))

NumDays = 
30

Determine the NumDays using a datatime array for EndDate.

MoreDays = [datetime(2000,3,15) ; datetime(2000,4,15) ; datetime(2000,6,15)];
NumDays = days360isda(datetime(2000,1,15), MoreDays)

NumDays = 3Ã—1
