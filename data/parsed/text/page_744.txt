Working with Other Portfolio Objects

This example shows how to examine portfolio optimization problems according to different
combinations of return and risk proxies.The PortfolioCVaR object is for CVaR portfolio
optimization. The Portfolio object is for mean-variance portfolio optimization. Sometimes, you
might want to examine portfolio optimization problems according to different combinations of return
and risk proxies. A common example is that you want to do a CVaR portfolio optimization and then
want to work primarily with moments of portfolio returns. Suppose that you set up a CVaR portfolio
optimization problem with:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

pwgt0 = [ 0.3; 0.3; 0.2; 0.1 ];

rng('default')
p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setAssetList(p, 'Bonds','Large-Cap Equities','Small-Cap Equities','Emerging Equities');
p = setInitPort(p, pwgt0);
p = simulateNormalScenariosByMoments(p, m, C, 20000);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
p = setProbabilityLevel(p, 0.9);

To work with the same problem in a mean-variance framework, you can use the scenarios from the
PortfolioCVaR object to set up a Portfolio object so that p contains a CVaR optimization
problem and q contains a mean-variance optimization problem based on the same data.

q = Portfolio('AssetList', p.AssetList);
q = estimateAssetMoments(q, p.getScenarios);
q = setDefaultConstraints(q);

pwgt = estimateFrontier(p);
qwgt = estimateFrontier(q);

Since each object has a different risk proxy, it is not possible to compare results side by side. To
obtain means and standard deviations of portfolio returns, you can use the functions associated with
each object to obtain:

pret = estimatePortReturn(p, pwgt);
pstd = estimatePortStd(p, pwgt);
qret = estimatePortReturn(q, qwgt);
qstd = estimatePortStd(q, qwgt);

[pret, qret]
