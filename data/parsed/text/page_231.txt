Setting 'Simple' Bounds Using the Portfolio Function or setBounds
Function

Both the Portfolio object and setBounds function implement scalar expansion on either the
LowerBound or UpperBound properties. If the NumAssets property is already set in the Portfolio
object, scalar arguments for either property expand to have the same value across all dimensions. In
addition, setBounds lets you specify NumAssets as an optional argument. Suppose that you have a
universe of 500 assets and you want to set common bound constraints on all assets in your universe.
Specifically, you are a long-only investor and want to hold no more than 5% of your portfolio in any
single asset. You can set these bound constraints in any of these equivalent ways:

p = Portfolio('NumAssets', 500, 'LowerBound', 0, 'UpperBound', 0.05,'BoundType', 'Simple');

or

p = Portfolio('NumAssets', 500);
p = setBounds(p, 0, 0.05,'BoundType','Simple');

or

p = Portfolio;
p = setBounds(p, 0, 0.05, 'NumAssets', 500,'BoundType','Simple');

To clear bound constraints from your Portfolio object, use either the Portfolio object or
setBounds with empty inputs for the properties to be cleared. For example, to clear the upper-bound
constraint from the Portfolio object p in the previous example:

p = Portfolio(p, 'UpperBound', []);
