Add Linear Inequality Constraint to a PortfolioCVaR Object

Set a linear inequality constraint to ensure that the first three assets constitute at most 50% of a
portfolio. Then add another linear inequality constraint to ensure that the last three assets constitute
at least 50% of a portfolio.

p = PortfolioCVaR;
A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];    % first inequality constraint
b = 0.5;
p = setInequality(p, A, b);

A = [ 0 0 -1 -1 -1 ];    % second inequality constraint
b = -0.5;
p = addInequality(p, A, b);

disp(p.NumAssets);

Add Linear Inequality Constraint to a PortfolioMAD Object

Set a linear inequality constraint to ensure that the first three assets constitute at most 50% of a

at least 50% of a portfolio.

p = PortfolioMAD;
A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];    % first inequality constraint
b = 0.5;
