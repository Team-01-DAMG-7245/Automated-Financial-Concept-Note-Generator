To support existing code, bndtotalreturn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are
not recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

HorizonPrice — Price at investment horizon date
calculated based on ReinvestRate (default) | numeric

Price at investment horizon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'HorizonPrice' and a scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector.

If HorizonPrice is unspecified, the price at the HorizonDate is calculated based on the
ReinvestRate. If the HorizonDate equals the Maturity date, the HorizonPrice is ignored and
the total return to maturity is calculated based on the Face value.

Data Types: double

Period — Number of coupon payments per year
2 (default) | numeric with values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 12

Number of coupon payments per year, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Period'
and a scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector using the values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.

Data Types: double

Basis — Day-count basis
0 (actual/actual) (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Day-count basis, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Basis' and a scalar or a
NINST-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

Data Types: double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer 0 or 1
