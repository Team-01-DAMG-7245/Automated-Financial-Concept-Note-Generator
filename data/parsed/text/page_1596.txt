Columns that are indicated in the CashAssets list are designated as cash assets. These assets
behave like regular assets, except that they do not contribute to transaction costs or portfolio
turnover.

When the backtestEngine name-value argument PayExpensesFromCash is set to true, and if
either CashAssets or DebtAssets are specified, the expenses encountered in the backtest
(transaction costs and other fees) are paid in the following order:

1
If specified, the assets in the CashAssets list, in order until all CashAssets are exhausted.

2
If specified, the first asset listed in the DebtAssets list incurs all remaining expenses. If no
DebtAssets is specified, then the final CashAssets balance goes negative to pay any remaining
expense.

Note The CashAssets are added to the available engine data for the backtestStrategy name-
value argument for EnginedataList.
