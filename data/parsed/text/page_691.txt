Working with Group Ratio Constraints Using PortfolioCVaR
Object

Group ratio constraints are optional linear constraints that maintain bounds on proportional
relationships among groups of assets (see “Group Ratio Constraints” on page 5-12). Although the
constraints are implemented as general constraints, the usual convention is to specify a pair of group
matrices that identify membership of each asset within specific groups with Boolean indicators
(either true or false or with 1 or 0) for each element in each of the group matrices. The goal is to
ensure that the ratio of a base group compared to a comparison group fall within specified bounds.
Group ratio constraints have properties:

•
GroupA for the base membership matrix

•
GroupB for the comparison membership matrix

•
LowerRatio for the lower-bound constraint on the ratio of groups

•
UpperRatio for the upper-bound constraint on the ratio of groups

Setting Group Ratio Constraints Using the PortfolioCVaR Function

The properties for group ratio constraints are set using PortfolioCVaR object. For example, assume
that you want the ratio of financial to nonfinancial companies in your portfolios to never go above
50%. Suppose that you have six assets with three financial companies (assets 1–3) and three
nonfinancial companies (assets 4–6). To set group ratio constraints:

GA = [ 1 1 1 0 0 0 ];    % financial companies
GB = [ 0 0 0 1 1 1 ];    % nonfinancial companies
p = PortfolioCVaR('GroupA', GA, 'GroupB', GB, 'UpperRatio', 0.5);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupA)
disp(p.GroupB)
disp(p.UpperRatio)

Group matrices GA and GB in this example can be logical matrices with true and false elements
that yield the same result:

GA = [ true true true false false false ];    % financial companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];    % nonfinancial companies
p = PortfolioCVaR('GroupA', GA, 'GroupB', GB, 'UpperRatio', 0.5);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupA)
disp(p.GroupB)
disp(p.UpperRatio)
