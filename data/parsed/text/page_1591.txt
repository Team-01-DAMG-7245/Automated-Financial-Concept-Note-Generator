However, if you look at the rebalance table, you can see that the strategy still "missed" the first
rebalance date. When you run the backtest over the test range of the data set, the first rebalance
date is on March 22. This is because the warm-up range is omitted from the price history and the
strategy had only 26 days of history available on that date (less than the minimum 30 days required
for the lookback window). Therefore, the March 22 rebalance is skipped.

To avoid backtesting over the warm-up range, the range was removed it from the data set. This
means the new backtest start date and all subsequent rebalance dates are 30 days later. The price
history data contained in the warm-up range was completely removed, so when the backtest engine
hit the first rebalance date the price history was insufficient to rebalance.
