This boxchart shows the distribution of the correlations of each asset with its respective portfolio.
The correlation of asset i to its portfolio is computed with the following formula:

ρiP =
Σx i
σi xTΣx

The MDP is the portfolio whose correlations are closer together and this is followed by the strategy
that uses the MDP penalty term. In fact, if the portfolio problem allowed negative weights, then all
the assets of the MDP would have the same correlation to its portfolio. Also, both the HH (EW) and
ERC portfolios have almost the same correlation variability.
