Business day conventions, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BusinessDayConvention' and a character vector or N-by-1 cell array of character vectors of
business day conventions. The selection for business day convention determines how non-business
days are treated. Non-business days are defined as weekends plus any other date that businesses are
not open (e.g. statutory holidays). Values are:

•
actual — Non-business days are effectively ignored. Cash flows that fall on non-business days
are assumed to be distributed on the actual date.

•
follow — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed on the
following business day.

•
modifiedfollow — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed on
the following business day. However if the following business day is in a different month, the
previous business day is adopted instead.

•
previous — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed on the
previous business day.

•
modifiedprevious — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed
on the previous business day. However if the previous business day is in a different month, the
following business day is adopted instead.
