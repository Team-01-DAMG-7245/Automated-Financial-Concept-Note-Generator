Instance Hierarchy

There are inheritance relationships among the SDE classes.

The following figure illustrates the inheritance relationships.

For more information, see “SDE Models” on page 14-7, “SDE Classes and Associated Simulation
Methods” on page 14-13, and “SDE Class Hierarchy” on page 14-5.

Algorithms

When you specify the required input parameters as arrays, they are associated with a specific
parametric form. By contrast, when you specify either required input parameter as a function, you
can customize virtually any specification.

Accessing the output parameters with no inputs simply returns the original input specification. Thus,
when you invoke these parameters with no inputs, they behave like simple properties and allow you
to test the data type (double vs. function, or equivalently, static vs. dynamic) of the original input
specification. This is useful for validating and designing methods.
