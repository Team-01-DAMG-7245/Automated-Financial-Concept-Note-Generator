Step 6. Evaluating gross vs. net portfolio returns.

The Portfolio object p does not include transaction costs so that the portfolio optimization problem
specified in p uses gross portfolio return as the return proxy. To handle net returns, create a second
Portfolio object q that includes transaction costs.

q = setCosts(p, UnitCost, UnitCost);
display(q)

q = 
  Portfolio with properties:
