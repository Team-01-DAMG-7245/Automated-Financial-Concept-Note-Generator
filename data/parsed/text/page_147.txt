Calling portalloc while specifying the output arguments returns the variance (RiskyRisk), the
expected return (RiskyReturn), and the weights (RiskyWts) allocated to the optimal risky portfolio.
It also returns the fraction (RiskyFraction) of the complete portfolio allocated to the risky
portfolio, and the variance (OverallRisk) and expected return (OverallReturn) of the optimal
overall portfolio. The overall portfolio combines investments in the risk-free asset and in the risky
portfolio. The actual proportion assigned to each of these two investments is determined by the
degree of risk aversion characterizing the investor.

[RiskyRisk, RiskyReturn, RiskyWts,RiskyFraction, OverallRisk, ... 
OverallReturn] = portalloc (PortRisk, PortReturn, PortWts, ... 
RisklessRate, BorrowRate, RiskAversion)

RiskyRisk = 
0.1288

RiskyReturn = 
0.1791

RiskyWts = 1Ã—3

0.0057    0.5879    0.4064

RiskyFraction = 
1.1869

OverallRisk = 
0.1529

OverallReturn = 
0.1902

The value of RiskyFraction exceeds 1 (100%), implying that the risk tolerance specified allows
borrowing money to invest in the risky portfolio, and that no money is invested in the risk-free asset.
