The simByEuler Euler approximation literally evaluates the stochastic differential equation directly
from the equation of motion, for some suitable value of the dt time increment. This simple
approximation suffers from discretization error. This error can be attributed to the discrepancy
between the choice of the dt time increment and what in theory is a continuous-time parameter.

The discrete-time approximation improves as DeltaTime approaches zero. The Euler function is
often the least accurate and most general method available. All models shipped in the simulation
suite have the simByEuler function.

In contrast, the simBySolution function provides a more accurate description of the underlying
model. This function simulates the price paths by an approximation of the closed-form solution of
separable models. Specifically, it applies a Euler approach to a transformed process, which in general
is not the exact solution to this GBM model. This is because the probability distributions of the
simulated and true state vectors are identical only for piecewise constant parameters.

When all model parameters are piecewise constant over each observation period, the simulated
process is exact for the observation times at which the state vector is sampled. Since all parameters
are constants in this example, simBySolution does indeed sample the exact solution.

For an example of how to use simBySolution to optimize the accuracy of solutions, see “Optimizing
Accuracy: About Solution Precision and Error” on page 14-66.

Simulating Equity Markets Using GBM Model with Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation

This example shows how to use simBySolution with a GBM model to perform a quasi-Monte Carlo
simulation. Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation is a Monte Carlo simulation that uses quasi-random
sequences instead pseudo random numbers.
