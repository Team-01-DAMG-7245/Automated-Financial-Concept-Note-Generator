Working with Budget Constraints Using PortfolioCVaR Object

The budget constraint is an optional linear constraint that maintains upper and lower bounds on the
sum of portfolio weights (see “Budget Constraints” on page 5-10). Budget constraints have properties
LowerBudget for the lower budget constraint and UpperBudget for the upper budget constraint. If
you set up a CVaR portfolio optimization problem that requires portfolios to be fully invested in your
universe of assets, you can set LowerBudget to be equal to UpperBudget. These budget constraints
can be set with default values equal to 1 using setDefaultConstraints (see “Setting Default
Constraints Using the PortfolioCVaR Function” on page 5-51).

Setting Budget Constraints Using the PortfolioCVaR Function

The properties for the budget constraint can also be set using the PortfolioCVaR object. Suppose
that you have an asset universe with many risky assets and a riskless asset and you want to ensure
that your portfolio never holds more than 1% cash, that is, you want to ensure that you are 99–100%
invested in risky assets. The budget constraint for this portfolio can be set with:

p = PortfolioCVaR('LowerBudget', 0.99, 'UpperBudget', 1);
disp(p.LowerBudget)
disp(p.UpperBudget)

0.9900

Setting Budget Constraints Using the setBudget Function

You can also set the properties for a budget constraint using setBudget. Suppose that you have a
fund that permits up to 10% leverage which means that your portfolio can be from 100% to 110%
invested in risky assets. Given a PortfolioCVaR object p, use setBudget to set the budget
constraints:

p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setBudget(p, 1, 1.1);
disp(p.LowerBudget)
disp(p.UpperBudget)

1.1000

If you were to continue with this example, then set the RiskFreeRate property to the borrowing
rate to finance possible leveraged positions. For details on the RiskFreeRate property, see “Working
with a Riskless Asset” on page 5-46. To clear either bound for the budget constraint from your
PortfolioCVaR object, use either the PortfolioCVaR object or setBudget with empty inputs for
the properties to be cleared. For example, clear the upper-budget constraint from the
PortfolioCVaR object p in the previous example with:

p = PortfolioCVaR(p, 'UpperBudget', []);
