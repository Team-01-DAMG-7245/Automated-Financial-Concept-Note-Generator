Machine Learning for Statistical Arbitrage: Introduction

Machine learning techniques for processing large amounts of data are broadly applicable in
computational finance. The series of examples introduced in this topic provides a general workflow,
illustrating how capabilities in MATLAB apply to a specific problem in financial engineering. The
workflow is problem-oriented, exploratory, and guided by the data and the resulting analysis. The
overall approach, however, is useful for constructing applications in many areas.

The workflow consists of these actions:

•
Formulate a simple approach to algorithmic trading, through an analysis of market
microstructure, with the goal of identifying real-time arbitrage opportunities.

•
Use a large sample of exchange data to track order dynamics of a single security on a single day,
selectively processing the data to develop relevant statistical measures.

•
Create a model of intraday dynamics conditioned on a selection of hyperparameters introduced
during feature engineering and development.

•
Evaluate hyperparameter tunings using a supervising objective that computes cash returned on a
model-based trading strategy.

•
Optimize the trading strategy using different machine learning algorithms.

•
Suggest modifications for further development.

The workflow is separated into three examples:
