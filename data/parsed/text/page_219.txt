As you can see, the moments match between th two portfolios. In addition, estimateAssetMoments
also extracts asset names or identifiers from a table or timetable when the argument name
'GetAssetList' is set to true (its default value is false). If the 'GetAssetList' value is true,
the identifiers are used to set the AssetList property of the Portfolio object. To show this, the
formation of the Portfolio object q is repeated from the previous code with the 'GetAssetList'
flag set to true and this extracts the column labels from a table or timetable object.

q = estimateAssetMoments(q,assetRetnTable,'GetAssetList',true);
disp(q.AssetList)

{'Bonds'}    {'LargeCap'}    {'SmallCap'}    {'Emerging'}

Note if you set the 'GetAssetList' flag set to true and your input data is in a matrix,
estimateAssetMoments uses the default labeling scheme from setAssetList described in
“Setting Up a List of Asset Identifiers” on page 4-33.
