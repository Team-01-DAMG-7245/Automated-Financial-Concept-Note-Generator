Time series array to encapsulate within a callable function of time and state, specified as a vector,
two-dimensional matrix, or three-dimensional array

Data Types: double

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: F = ts2func(yields,'Times',(0:nPeriods - 1)')

Times — Monotonically increasing observation times associated with the time series input
array Array
zero-based, unit-increment vector of the same length as that of the dimension of Array (default) |
vector

Monotonically increasing observation times associated with the time series input array (Array),
specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Times' and a vector.

Data Types: double

TimeDimension — Specifies which dimension of the input time series array Array is
associated with time
1 (indicates that time is associated with the rows of Array) (default) | scalar integer

Specifies which dimension of the input time series array (Array) is associated with time, specified as
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'TimeDimension' and a scalar integer.

Data Types: double

StateDimension — Specifies which dimension of the input time series array Array is
associated with the NVars state variables
first dimension of Array not already associated with time is associated with first available dimension
of Array not already assigned to TimeDimension (default) | positive scalar integer

Specifies which dimension of the input time series array (Array) is associated with the NVars state
variables, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'StateDimension' and a positive
scalar integer.

Data Types: double

Deterministic — Flag to indicate whether the output function is a deterministic function
of time alone
false (meaning F is a callable function of time and state, F(t,X)) (default) | scalar logical

Flag to indicate whether the output function is a deterministic function of time alone, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'Determininistic' and a scalar integer flag.

If Deterministic is true, the output function F is a deterministic function of time, F(t), and the only
input it accepts is a scalar, real-valued time t. If Deterministic is false, the output function F
accepts two inputs, a scalar, real-valued time t followed by an NVars-by-1 state vectorX(t).
