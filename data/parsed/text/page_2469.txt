Line Break Chart

A line break chart is a type of financial chart used to represent price movements of an asset over
time, focusing on price action rather than time intervals.

The line break chart is particularly useful for identifying trends and reversals in price movements
without the noise of time-based charts, such as candlestick or bar charts. Line break charts help
traders and analysts make decisions based on significant price changes. A line break chart contains a
series of vertical lines that represent price movements. Each line is drawn based on a specific price
threshold rather than a fixed time interval. The chart consists of a series of "lines" that change
direction based on price movements. A new line is drawn when the price moves a certain amount
beyond the previous line.
