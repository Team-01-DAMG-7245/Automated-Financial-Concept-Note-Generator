Due to the following identity

rc(t) = log
pc(t)
pc(t −1)

=log(pc(t)) −log(pc(t −1))

= [real(log(pc(t)) −real(log(pc(t −1)))]

+ [imag(log(pc(t))) −imag(log(pc(t −1)))]

⋅i,

you can read the real part of a continuous return as a difference in ordinates on the blue graph, and
you can read the imaginary part as a difference in ordinates on the red graph. Absolute price
movements toward zero result in a negative real part and absolute price movements away from zero
result in a positive real part. Likewise, changes of sign result in a jump of ±π in the imaginary part,
with the sign change depending on the direction of the move.

For example, the plot below superimposes the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm at prices p =
−4 and p = 2, with lines to help visualize their differences.

p = [-4; 2];
plot(p,real(log(p)),"bo-",MarkerFaceColor="b")
plot(p,imag(log(p)),"ro-",MarkerFaceColor="r")
