Dividing Matrices

Matrix division is useful primarily for solving equations, and especially for solving simultaneous linear
equations (see “Solving Simultaneous Linear Equations” on page 1-11). For example, you want to
solve for X in A*X = B.

In ordinary algebra, you would divide both sides of the equation by A, and X would equal B/A.
However, since matrix algebra is not commutative (A*X ≠ X*A), different processes apply. In formal
matrix algebra, the solution involves matrix inversion. MATLAB, however, simplifies the process by
providing two matrix division symbols, left and right (\ and /). In general,

X = A\B solves for X in A*X = B and

X = B/A solves for X in X*A = B.

In general, matrix A must be a nonsingular square matrix; that is, it must be invertible and it must
have the same number of rows and columns. (Generally, a matrix is invertible if the matrix times its
inverse equals the identity matrix. To understand the theory and proofs, consult a textbook on linear
algebra such as Elementary Linear Algebra by Hill listed in “Bibliography” on page A-2.) MATLAB
gives a warning message if the matrix is singular or nearly so.

Solving Simultaneous Linear Equations

Matrix division is especially useful in solving simultaneous linear equations. Consider this problem:
Given two portfolios of mortgage-based instruments, each with certain yields depending on the prime
rate, how do you weight the portfolios to achieve certain annual cash flows? The answer involves
solving two linear equations.

A linear equation is any equation of the form

a1x + a2y = b,

where a1, a2, and b are constants (with a1 and a2 not both 0), and x and y are variables. (It is a linear
equation because it describes a line in the xy-plane. For example, the equation 2x + y = 8 describes a
line such that if x = 2, then y = 4.)

A system of linear equations is a set of linear equations that you usually want to solve at the same
time; that is, simultaneously. A basic principle for exact answers in solving simultaneous linear
equations requires that there be as many equations as there are unknowns. To get exact answers for
x and y, there must be two equations. For example, to solve for x and y in the system of linear
equations

2x + y = 13
x −3y = −18,
