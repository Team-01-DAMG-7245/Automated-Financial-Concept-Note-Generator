Input Arguments

Data — Data with high, low, open, close information
matrix | table | timetable

Data with high, low, open, close information, specified as a vector, matrix, table, or timetable. For
matrix input, Data is an M-by-2 matrix of high and low prices stored in the first and second columns.
Timetables and tables with M rows must contain variables named 'High' and 'Low' (case
insensitive).

Data Types: double | table | timetable

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: volatility = chaikvolat(TMW,'NumPeriods',10,'WindowSize',10)

NumPeriods — Period difference
10 (default) | positive integer

Period difference, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'NumPeriods' and a scalar
positive integer.

Data Types: double

WindowSize — Length of the exponential moving average in periods
10 (default) | positive integer

Length of the exponential moving average in periods, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'WindowSize' and a scalar positive integer.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

volatility — Chaikin volatility
matrix | table | timetable

Chaikin volatility, returned with the same number of rows (M) and the same type (matrix, table, or
timetable) as the input Data.
