The performance of both strategies is similar, although not identical. This similarity is because the
factor model strategy uses the number of factors identified by covarianceDenoising to select the
number of principal components. Factor model strategies are usually not implemented this way, but
rather the number of factors is a fixed parameter that is chosen a priori.

In this example, the number of factors that is most frequently identified is 1.

% Count the number of different factors
categoricalNumFactors = ...
    categorical(backtester.Strategies(1).UserData.numFactors);
[N,uniqueFactors] = histcounts(categoricalNumFactors);
factorFrequency = table(uniqueFactors',N', ...
    'VariableNames',{'NumFactors','Frequency'})

factorFrequency=3×2 table
    NumFactors    Frequency
    __________    _________

{'1' }         81    
      {'2' }         12    
      {'17'}          1

Therefore, you can run the factor modeling strategy using 1 as the number of factors instead of using
covarianceDenoising to identify the number of factors at each rebalancing period.
