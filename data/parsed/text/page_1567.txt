Performance Hurdle

A hurdle is an optional feature of a performance fee.

A hurdle sets a minimum performance threshold that a fund must beat before the performance fee is
charged. Hurdles can be fixed rates of return, a hurdle rate, such as 5%. For example, if the fund NAV
goes from $1M to $1.2M, the performance fee is charged only on the performance beyond 5%. A 5%
hurdle rate on $1M sets the target hurdle value at $1.05M. The $1.2M portfolio is $150k over the
hurdle value. The performance fee is charged only on that $150k, so 20% of $150k is a $30k
performance fee.

The following figure illustrates a 5% hurdle rate.

You can also specify a performance hurdle as a benchmark asset or index. In this case, the
performance fee is paid only on the fund performance in excess of the hurdle instrument. For
example, assume that the fund NAV goes from $1M to $1.2M and you have specified the S&P500 as
your hurdle. If the S&P500 index returns 25% over the same period, then no performance fee is paid
because the fund did not produce returns in excess of the hurdle instrument. If the fund value is
greater than the hurdle, but still less than the previous high-water mark, again, no performance fee is
paid.

At each performance fee date, the fund charges the performance fee on the difference between the
current fund value and the maximum of the high-water mark and the hurdle value. The high-water
mark is updated only if a performance fee is paid.
