Credit Default Swap (CDS)

A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract that protects against losses resulting from credit defaults.
The transaction involves two parties, the protection buyer and the protection seller, and also a
reference entity, usually a bond. The protection buyer pays a stream of premiums to the protection
seller, who in exchange offers to compensate the buyer for the loss in the bond’s value if a credit
event occurs. The stream of premiums is called the premium leg, and the compensation when a credit
event occurs is called the protection leg. Credit events usually include situations in which the bond
issuer goes bankrupt, misses coupon payments, or enters a restructuring process. Financial
