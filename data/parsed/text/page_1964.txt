Brownian Bridge

A Brownian bridge is used to simulate portfolio values at intermediate dates to compute collateral
available at the subsequent simulation dates.

For example, to estimate collateral available at a particular simulation date, ti, you need to know the
state of the portfolio at time ti – dt, where dt is the margin period of risk. Portfolio values are
simulated at these intermediate dates by drawing from a distribution defined by the Brownian bridge
between ti and the previous simulation date, ti–1.

If the contract values at time ti –1 and ti are known and you want to estimate the contract value at time
tc (where tc is ti – dt), then a sample from a normal distribution is used with variance:

(ti  − tc)(tc  − ti −1)
(ti  − ti −1)

and with mean that is simply the linear interpolation of the contract values between the two
simulation dates at time tc. For more details, see References.
