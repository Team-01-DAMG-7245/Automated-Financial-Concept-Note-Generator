inforatio

Calculate information ratio for one or more assets

Syntax

inforatio(Asset,Benchmark)
[Ratio,TE] = inforatio(Asset,Benchmark)

Description

inforatio(Asset,Benchmark) computes the information ratio for each asset relative to the
Benchmark.

[Ratio,TE] = inforatio(Asset,Benchmark) computes the information ratio and tracking error
for each asset relative to the Benchmark.

Examples

Compute Information Ratio

This example show how to calculate the information ratio using inforatio with example data,
where the mean return of the market series is used as the return of the benchmark.

You can use inforatio to compute the information ratio for the given asset return data and the riskless
asset return.

load FundMarketCash 
Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
Benchmark = Returns(:,2);
InfoRatio = inforatio(Returns, Benchmark)

InfoRatio = 1×3

0.0432       NaN   -0.0315

Since the market series has no risk relative to itself, the information ratio for the second series is
undefined (which is represented as NaN in MATLAB®.

Use Information Ratio to Compute Tracking Error

This example show how to calculate the tracking error using inforatio with example data, where
the mean return of the market series is used as the return of the benchmark.

Given an asset or portfolio of assets and a benchmark, the relative standard deviation of returns
between the asset or portfolio of assets and the benchmark is called tracking error.
