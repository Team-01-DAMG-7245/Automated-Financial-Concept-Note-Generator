Arithmetic covariance of asset-return data, specified as an n-by-n symmetric, positive semidefinite
matrix. If Ca is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use nearcorr to create a positive
semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

Data Types: double

t — Target period of geometric moments in terms of periodicity of arithmetic moments
1 (default) | scalar positive numeric

(Optional) Target period of geometric moments in terms of periodicity of arithmetic moments,
specified as a scalar positive numeric.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

mg — Continuously compounded or "geometric" mean of asset returns over the target
period
vector

Continuously compounded or "geometric" mean of asset returns over the target period (t), returned
as an n-vector.

Cg — Continuously compounded or "geometric" covariance of asset returns over the target
period
matrix

Continuously compounded or "geometric" covariance of asset returns over the target period (t),
returned as an n-by-n matrix.

Algorithms

Arithmetic returns over period tA are modeled as multivariate normal random variables with moments

E[X] = mA

and

cov(X) = CA

Geometric returns over period tG are modeled as multivariate lognormal random variables with
moments

E[Y] = 1 + mG

cov(Y) = CG

Given t = tG / tA, the transformation from geometric to arithmetic moments is

1 + mGi = exp(tmAi + 1
2tCAii)

CGi j = (1 + mGi)(1 + mGj)(exp(tCAi j) −1)

For i,j = 1,..., n.
