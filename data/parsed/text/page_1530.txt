The rough Bergomi model is a type of stochastic volatility model, which means it assumes that the
volatility of the underlying asset is not constant but varies over time and is not necessarily correlated
with the asset price.

The first and second equations represent a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model with a
stochastic volatility function.

The third equation represents the process describing the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled
GBM process, where Yt is a Volterra process. In a Volterra process, the increments are not only
dependent on the current state of the process but also on the entire history of the process. This
means that the current state of the process is determined by integrating a function over the entire
past trajectory of the process, as opposed to just the most recent state.
