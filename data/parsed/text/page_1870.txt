by-NUMBONDS vector. LastCouponInterest is based on only the last coupon and the face value to
be repaid. Acceptable values are:

•
simple

•
compound

Data Types: char | cell

Output Arguments

Price — Clean price of bond
numeric

Clean price of bond, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector. The dirty price of the bond is the clean
price plus the accrued interest. It equals the present value of the bond cash flows of the yield to
maturity with semiannual compounding.

AccruedInt — Accrued interest payable at settlement
numeric

accrued interest payable at settlement, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

Price and Yield Conventions

The Price and Yield are related to different formulae for SIA and ICMA conventions.

For SIA conventions, Price and Yield are related by the formula:

Price + Accrued Interest = sum(Cash_Flow*(1+Yield/2)^(-Time))

where the sum is over the bond's cash flows and corresponding times in units of semiannual coupon
periods.

For ICMA conventions, the Price and Yield are related by the formula:

Price + Accrued Interest = sum(Cash_Flow*(1+Yield)^(-Time))

Algorithms

For SIA conventions, the following formula defines bond price and yield:

PV = ∑
i = 1

n
CF

(1 + z
f )
TF ,

where:

PV =
Present value of a cash flow.

CF =
Cash flow amount.
