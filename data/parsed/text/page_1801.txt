blslambda

Black-Scholes elasticity

Syntax

[CallEl,PutEl] = blslambda(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
[CallEl,PutEl] = blslambda( ___ ,Yield)

Description

[CallEl,PutEl] = blslambda(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns the elasticity
of an option. CallEl is the call option elasticity or leverage factor, and PutEl is the put option
elasticity or leverage factor. Elasticity (the leverage of an option position) measures the percent
change in an option price per 1 percent change in the underlying asset price. blslambda uses
normcdf, the normal cumulative distribution function in the Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and lambda values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blslambda can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

[CallEl,PutEl] = blslambda( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Find the Black-Scholes Elasticity (Lambda) for an Option

This example shows how to find the Black-Scholes elasticity, or leverage, of an option position.

[CallEl, PutEl] = blslambda(50, 50, 0.12, 0.25, 0.3)

CallEl = 
8.1274

PutEl = 
-8.6466
