Assume a face value of $100. Specify a purchase price of $95.70, a coupon rate of 4%, quarterly
coupon payments, and a 30/360 day-count convention (Basis = 1).

Price        = 95.7;
CouponRate   = 0.04;
Period       = 4;
Basis        = 1;
EndMonthRule = 1;

Call the bndyield function.

Yield = bndyield(Price, CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, Period, ... 
Basis, EndMonthRule, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate)

Yield = 
0.0659

The function returns a Yield = 0.0659 (6.60%).

Fixed-Income Sensitivities

Financial Toolbox software supports the following options for managing interest-rate risk for one or
more bonds:

•
bnddurp and bnddury support duration and convexity analysis based on market quotes and
assume parallel shifts in the bond yield curve.

•
bndkrdur supports key rate duration based on a market yield curve and can model nonparallel
shifts in the bond yield curve.

Calculating Duration and Convexity for Bonds

This example shows how to compute the annualized Macaulay and modified durations and the
periodic Macaulay duration for a bond.

The Macaulay duration of an income stream, such as a coupon bond, measures how long, on average,
the owner waits before receiving a payment. It is the weighted average of the times payments are
made, with the weights at time T equal to the present value of the money received at time T. The
modified duration is the Macaulay duration discounted by the per-period interest rate; that is, divided
by (1+rate/frequency). The Macaulay duration is a measure of price sensitivity to yield changes. This
duration is measured in years and is a weighted average-time-to-maturity of an instrument.

To illustrate, the following code computes the annualized Macaulay and modified durations and the
periodic Macaulay duration for a bond with settlement (12-Jan-2000) and maturity (01-Oct-2001)
dates, a 5% coupon rate, and a 4.5% yield to maturity. For simplicity, any optional input arguments
assume default values (that is, semiannual coupons, and day-count basis = 0 (actual/actual), coupon
payment structure synchronized to the maturity date, and end-of-month payment rule in effect).

CouponRate = 0.05;
Yield = 0.045;
Settle = datetime(2000,1,12);
Maturity = datetime(2001,10,1);

[ModDuration, YearDuration, PerDuration] = bnddury(Yield, ... 
CouponRate, Settle, Maturity)
