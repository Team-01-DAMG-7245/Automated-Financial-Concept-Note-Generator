The risky LSTM model accuracy is about 61%. Despite this low value, the confusion chart suggests
the following other aspects about the model's performance as it pertains to the trading strategy.

•
It correctly predicted about 65% of the 86 true gains, which makes money.

•
It correctly predicted about 79% of the 131 true losses, which prevents money loss.

•
It incorrectly predicted about 35% of the true gains as losses or constant, which results is a
missed opportunity to make money.

•
It incorrectly predicted about 2% of the true losses as gains, which results in a money loss.
