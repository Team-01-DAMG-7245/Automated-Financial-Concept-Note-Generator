Summary

This example introduces the basics of working with big data, both in and out of memory. It shows how
to set up, combine, and update external datastores, then create tall arrays for preprocessing data
without allocating variables in the MATLAB workspace. The gather function transfers data into the
workspace for computation and further analysis. The example shows how to visualize the data
through data sampling or by MATLAB plotting functions that work directly with out-of-memory data.
