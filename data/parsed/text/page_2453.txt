A life table provides a detailed breakdown of the probability of death and survival at various ages,
allowing for the analysis of life expectancy and the assessment of the health status of a population.

Forced Termination

Most modern life tables have “forced” termination. Forced termination means that the last row of the
life table applies for all persons with ages on or after the last age in the life table.

This sample illustrates forced termination.

In this case, the last row of the life table applies for all persons aged 100 or older. Specifically, qx
probabilities are 1qx for ages less than 100 and, technically, ∞qx for age 100.

Forced termination has terminal age values that apply to all ages after the terminal age so that lx is
positive, qx is 1, and dx is positive. Ages after the terminal age are NaN values, although lx and dx
can be 0 and qx can be 1 for input series. Forced termination is triggered by a naturally terminating
series, the last age in a truncated series, or the first NaN value in a series.

Natural Termination

Before 1970, life tables were often published with data that included all ages for which persons
associated with a given series were still alive. Tables in this form have "natural" termination. In
natural termination, the last row of the life table for each series counts the deaths or probabilities of
deaths of the last remaining person at the corresponding age. Tables in this form can be problematic
due to the granularity of the data and the fact that groups of series can terminate at distinct ages.
Natural termination is illustrated in the following sample of the last few years of a life table.

This form for life tables poses a number of issues that go beyond the obvious statistical issues. First,
the lx table on the left terminates at ages 108, 109, 109, and 113 for the four series in the table.
