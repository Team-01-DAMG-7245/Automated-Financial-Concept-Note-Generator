Supported Constraints for Portfolio Optimization Using
PortfolioMAD Object

The final element for a complete specification of a portfolio optimization problem is the set of feasible

portfolios, which is called a portfolio set. A portfolio set X ⊂Rn is specified by construction as the
intersection of sets formed by a collection of constraints on portfolio weights. A portfolio set
necessarily and sufficiently must be a nonempty, closed, and bounded set.

When setting up your portfolio set, ensure that the portfolio set satisfies these conditions. The most
basic or “default” portfolio set requires portfolio weights to be nonnegative (using the lower-bound
constraint) and to sum to 1 (using the budget constraint). The most general portfolio set handled by
the portfolio optimization tools can have any of these constraints and which are properties for the
PortfolioMAD object:

•
Linear inequality constraints

•
Linear equality constraints

•
'Simple' Bound constraints

•
'Conditional' Bound constraints

•
Budget constraints

•
Conditional budget constraints

•
Group constraints

•
Group ratio constraints

•
Average turnover constraints

•
One-way turnover constraints

•
Cardinality constraints

Linear Inequality Constraints

Linear inequality constraints are general linear constraints that model relationships among portfolio
weights that satisfy a system of inequalities. Linear inequality constraints take the form

AIx ≤bI

where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

AI is the linear inequality constraint matrix (nI-by-n matrix).

bI is the linear inequality constraint vector (nI vector).

n is the number of assets in the universe and nI is the number of constraints.

PortfolioMAD object properties to specify linear inequality constraints are:

•
AInequality for AI
•
bInequality for bI
•
NumAssets for n
