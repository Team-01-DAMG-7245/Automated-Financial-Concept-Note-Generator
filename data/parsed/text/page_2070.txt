PreviousCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   30-Nov-1996
   10-Dec-1997

Note that since the settlement date for the second bond is also a coupon date, cpndatep returns this
date as the previous coupon date.

Now establish a FirstCouponDate and IssueDate for this pair of bonds.

FirstCouponDate = [datetime(1997,11,30) ; datetime(1998,12,10)]; 
IssueDate = [datetime(1996,5,30) ; datetime(1996,12,10)];

Recompute the PreviousCouponDate for this pair of bonds.

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, 1, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate)

PreviousCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   30-May-1996
   10-Dec-1996

Since both of these bonds settled before the first coupon had been paid, cpndatep returns the
IssueDate as the PreviousCouponDate.

Using the same data, compute PreviousQuasiCouponDate.

PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq(Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, 1,IssueDate, FirstCouponDate)

PreviousQuasiCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   30-Nov-1996
   10-Dec-1997

For the first bond the settlement date is not a normal coupon date. The PreviousQuasiCouponDate
is the coupon date before or on the settlement date. Since the coupon structure is synchronized to
FirstCouponDate, the previous quasi coupon date is 30-Nov-1996. PreviousQuasiCouponDate
disregards IssueDate and FirstCouponDate in this case. For the second bond the settlement date
(10-Dec-1997) occurs on a date when a coupon would normally be paid in the absence of an explicit
FirstCouponDate. cpndatepq returns this date as PreviousQuasiCouponDate.

Input Arguments

Settle — Settlement date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. Settle must be earlier than Maturity.

To support existing code, cpndatepq also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector
