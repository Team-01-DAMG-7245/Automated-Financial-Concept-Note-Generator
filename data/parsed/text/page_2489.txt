Syntax

ma = movavg(Data,type,windowSize)
ma = movavg( ___ ,initialPoints)

ma = movavg(Data,type,weights)
ma = movavg( ___ ,initialPoints)

Description

ma = movavg(Data,type,windowSize) computes the moving average (MA) of a financial time
series.

ma = movavg( ___ ,initialPoints) adds an optional argument for initialPoints.

ma = movavg(Data,type,weights) computes the moving average (MA) of a financial time series
using a 'custom' type and weights.

Examples

Calculate the Moving Average for a Data Series

Load the file SimulatedStock.mat and compute the moving average using simulated closing price
data.

load SimulatedStock.mat
type = 'linear';
windowSize = 14;
ma = movavg(TMW_CLOSE,type,windowSize)

ma = 1000Ã—1
