Output Arguments

a — Parameter estimates for each num series
matrix

Parameter estimates for each num series, returned as a numparam-by-num matrix.

elx — Estimated collection of num standardized survivor series
matrix

Estimated collection of num standardized survivor series, returned as an N-by-num matrix. The elx
output series is the number of people alive at age x, given 100,000 alive at birth. Values of 0 or NaN in
the input table lx are ignored.

More About

Life Table

A life table is a statistical table used in demography and actuarial science to summarize the mortality
experience of a population.

A life table provides a detailed breakdown of the probability of death and survival at various ages,
allowing for the analysis of life expectancy and the assessment of the health status of a population.
