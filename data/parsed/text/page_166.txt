correspond to the budget equality constraint; the remaining rows correspond to the upper/lower
investment bounds.

AbsConSet = portcons('PortValue', 1, NumAssets, ... 
'AssetLims', zeros(NumAssets,1), ones(NumAssets,1));

Transform the absolute constraints to active constraints with abs2active.

ActiveConSet = abs2active(AbsConSet, Index);

An examination of the absolute and active constraint matrices reveals that they differ only in the last
column (the columns corresponding to the b in A*w <= b.

In particular, note that the sum-to-one absolute budget constraint becomes a sum-to-zero active
budget constraint. The general transformation is as follows:

Construct the Portfolio object and plot the tracking error efficient frontier with 21 portfolios.

p = Portfolio('AssetMean', ExpReturn, 'AssetCovar', ExpCovariance);
p = p.setInequality(ActiveConSet(:,1:end-1), ActiveConSet(:,end));
[ActiveRisk, ActiveReturn] = p.plotFrontier(21);
