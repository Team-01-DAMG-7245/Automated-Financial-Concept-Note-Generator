??? Error using ==> ecmnmle
Full covariance not positive-definite in iteration 218.

From a practical standpoint, if in doubt, test your residual covariance matrix from the regression
routines to ensure that it is positive-definite. This is important because a soft error has a matrix that
appears to be positive-definite but actually has a near-zero-valued eigenvalue to within machine
precision. To do this with a covariance estimate Covariance, use cond(Covariance), where any
value greater than 1/eps should be considered suspect.

If either type of failure occurs, however, note that the regression routine is indicating that something
is probably wrong with the data. (Even with no missing data, two time series that are proportional to
one another produce a singular covariance matrix.)
