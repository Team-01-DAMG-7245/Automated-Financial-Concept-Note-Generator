addEquality

Add linear equality constraints for portfolio weights to existing constraints

Syntax

obj = addEquality(obj,AEquality,bEquality)

Description

obj = addEquality(obj,AEquality,bEquality) adds linear equality constraints for portfolio
weights to existing constraints for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD objects. For
details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

Given a linear equality constraint matrix AEquality and vector bEquality, every weight in a
portfolio Port must satisfy the following:

AEquality * Port = bEquality

This function "stacks" additional linear equality constraints onto any existing linear equality
constraints that exist in the input portfolio object. If no constraints exist, this method is the same as
setEquality.

Examples

Add a Linear Equality Constraint for a Portfolio Object

Use the addEquality method to create linear equality constraints. Add another linear equality
constraint to ensure that the last three assets constitute 50% of a portfolio.

p = Portfolio;
A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];    % First equality constraint
b = 0.5;
p = setEquality(p, A, b);

A = [ 0 0 1 1 1 ];    % Second equality constraint
b = 0.5;
p = addEquality(p, A, b);

disp(p.NumAssets);

     0     0     1     1     1

disp(p.bEquality);
