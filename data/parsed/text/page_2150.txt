depgendb

General declining-balance depreciation schedule

Syntax

Depreciation = depgendb(Cost,Salvage,Life,Factor)

Description

Depreciation = depgendb(Cost,Salvage,Life,Factor) computes the declining-balance
depreciation for each period.

Examples

Calculate the Declining-Balance Depreciation

A car is purchased for $10,000 and is to be depreciated over five years. The estimated salvage value
is $1000. Using the double-declining-balance method, the function calculates the depreciation for
each year and returns the remaining depreciable value at the end of the life of the car.

Define the depreciation.

Life = 5;
Salvage = 0;
Cost = 10000;
Factor=2;

Use depgendb to calculate the depreciation.

Depreciation = depgendb(10000, 1000, 5, 2)

Depreciation = 1×5
103 ×

4.0000    2.4000    1.4400    0.8640    0.2960

The large value returned at the final year is the sum of the depreciation over the life time and is equal
to the difference between the Cost and Salvage. The value of the asset in the final year is computed
as (Cost - Salvage) = Sum_Depreciation_Upto_Final_Year.

Input Arguments

Cost — Initial value of the asset
numeric

initial value of the asset, specified as a scalar numeric.
