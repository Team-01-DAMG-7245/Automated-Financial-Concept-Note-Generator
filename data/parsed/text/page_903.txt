Performance Metrics Illustration

To illustrate the functions for investment performance metrics, you work with three financial time
series objects using performance data for:

•
An actively managed, large-cap value mutual fund

•
A large-cap market index

•
90-day Treasury bills

The data is monthly total return prices that cover a span of five years.

The following plot illustrates the performance of each series in terms of total returns to an initial $1
invested at the start of this 5-year period:

load FundMarketCash
plot(TestData)
hold on
title('\bfFive-Year Total Return Performance');
legend('Fund','Market','Cash','Location','SouthEast');
hold off

The mean (Mean) and standard deviation (Sigma) of returns for each series are

Returns = tick2ret(TestData);
Assets
Mean = mean(Returns)
Sigma = std(Returns, 1)

which gives the following result:

Assets = 
    'Fund'    'Market'    'Cash'
Mean =
