Compute the weights of 15 portfolios on the efficient frontier using estimateFrontier. These
portfolios represent the possible actions at each rebalancing period.

numPortfolios = 15;
pwgt = estimateFrontier(p,numPortfolios);

Plot the efficient frontier using plotFrontier.

figure
[prsk,pret] = plotFrontier(p,pwgt);
hold on
scatter(prsk,pret,"red","o","LineWidth",2)
hold off

Use rlFiniteSetSpec (Reinforcement Learning Toolbox) to create the discrete action space for the
reinforcement learning environment.

actionInfo = rlFiniteSetSpec(1:15);

Define Observations

The observations are defined as elements of the environment that describe important aspects of the
current state. In this example the observations consist of the current time period t and the wealth at
that time periodWt. Use rlNumericSpec (Reinforcement Learning Toolbox) to create the
observations space, a 2 Ã— 1  vector containing two signals: the wealth level and the time period.

% Observation space:
%   [wealth; timePeriod]
observationInfo = rlNumericSpec([2 1]);
