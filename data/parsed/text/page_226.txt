Working with Portfolio Constraints Using Defaults

The final element for a complete specification of a portfolio optimization problem is the set of feasible

portfolios, which is called a portfolio set. A portfolio set X ⊂Rn is specified by construction as the
intersection of sets formed by a collection of constraints on portfolio weights. A portfolio set
necessarily and sufficiently must be a nonempty, closed, and bounded set.

When setting up your portfolio set, ensure that the portfolio set satisfies these conditions. The most
basic or “default” portfolio set requires portfolio weights to be nonnegative (using the lower-bound
constraint) and to sum to 1 (using the budget constraint). For information on the workflow when
using Portfolio objects, see “Portfolio Object Workflow” on page 4-18.

Setting Default Constraints for Portfolio Weights Using Portfolio
Object

The “default” portfolio problem has two constraints on portfolio weights:

•
Portfolio weights must be nonnegative.

•
Portfolio weights must sum to 1.

Implicitly, these constraints imply that portfolio weights are no greater than 1, although this is a
superfluous constraint to impose on the problem.

Setting Default Constraints Using the Portfolio Function

Given a portfolio optimization problem with NumAssets = 20 assets, use the Portfolio object to
set up a default problem and explicitly set bounds and budget constraints:

p = Portfolio('NumAssets', 20, 'LowerBound', 0, 'Budget', 1);
disp(p)
