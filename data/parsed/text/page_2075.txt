PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(datetime(1997,3,14),datetime(2000,6,30),2, 0, 0)

PreviousCouponDate = datetime
   30-Dec-1996

Determine the PreviousCouponDate when using character vectors for input arguments and the
optional argument for EndMonthRule.

PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(datetime(1997,3,14),datetime(2000,6,30),2, 0, 1)

PreviousCouponDate = datetime
   31-Dec-1996

Determine the PreviousCouponDate when using an input vector for Maturity.

Maturity = [datetime(2000,4,30) ; datetime(2000,5,31) ; datetime(2000,6,30)];
PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(datetime(1997,3,14), Maturity)

PreviousCouponDate = 3×1 datetime
   31-Oct-1996
   30-Nov-1996
   31-Dec-1996

To support existing code, cpndatep also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector
