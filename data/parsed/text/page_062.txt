End-of-Month Rule

The end-of-month rule affects a bond's coupon payment structure. When the rule is in effect, a
security that pays a coupon on the last actual day of a month will always pay coupons on the last day
of the month. This means, for example, that a semiannual bond that pays a coupon on February 28 in
nonleap years will pay coupons on August 31 in all years and on February 29 in leap years.

Framework

Although not all Financial Toolbox functions require the same input arguments, they all accept the
following common set of input arguments.

Common Input Arguments

Input
Meaning

Settle
Settlement date

Maturity
Maturity date

Period
Coupon payment period

Basis
Day-count basis

EndMonthRule
End-of-month payment rule

IssueDate
Bond issue date

FirstCouponDate
First coupon payment date

LastCouponDate
Last coupon payment date

Of the common input arguments, only Settle and Maturity are required. All others are optional.
They are set to the default values if you do not explicitly set them. By default, the FirstCouponDate
and LastCouponDate are nonapplicable. In other words, if you do not specify FirstCouponDate
and LastCouponDate, the bond is assumed to have no odd first or last coupon periods. In this case,
the bond is a standard bond with a coupon payment structure based solely on the maturity date.

Default Parameter Values

To illustrate the use of default values in Financial Toolbox functions, consider the cfdates function,
which computes actual cash flow payment dates for a portfolio of fixed income securities regardless
of whether the first and/or last coupon periods are normal, long, or short.

The complete calling syntax with the full input argument list is

CFlowDates = cfdates(Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis, ... 
EndMonthRule, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, LastCouponDate)

while the minimal calling syntax requires only settlement and maturity dates

CFlowDates = cfdates(Settle, Maturity)
