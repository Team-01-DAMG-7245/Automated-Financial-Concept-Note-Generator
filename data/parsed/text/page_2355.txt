More About

Discount Margin

The discount margin is the spread between the expected yield on a floating-rate security and the
benchmark interest rate, adjusted for the expected cash flows of the security.

Version History
Introduced in R2012b

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although floatdiscmargin supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended
instead. The datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond
precision, and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
