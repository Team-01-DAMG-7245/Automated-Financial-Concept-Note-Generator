[coeffs, scores, eigVals] = pca( normalizedVolatility );

Visualize the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the normalized volatilities.

figure
plot( eigVals, "o-", "LineWidth", 2 )
xlabel( "Principal Component" )
ylabel( "Eigenvalue" )
title( "Principal Component Eigenvalues" )
grid( "on" )

You can see that most of the variance in the data is captured by the first few principal components.

Visualize the first two principal components.

numComponents = 2;

    plot( InferredVolatility.Date, scores(:, k ) )
