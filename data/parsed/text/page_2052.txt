Standard deviation of each process, returned as an 1-by-n vector.

The entries of ExpCorrC range from 1 (completely correlated) to -1 (completely anti-correlated). A
value of 0 in the (i,j) entry indicates that the i'th and j'th processes are uncorrelated.

ExpSigma(i) = sqrt( ExpCovariance(i,i) );
ExpCorrC(i,j) = ExpCovariance(i,j)/( ExpSigma(i)*ExpSigma(j) );

Data Types: double
