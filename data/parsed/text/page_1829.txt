bndconvp

Bond convexity given price

Syntax

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvp(Price,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)
[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvp( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvp(Price,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)
computes the convexity of NUMBONDS fixed income securities given a clean price for each bond. The
clean price of a bond excludes any interest that has accrued since issue or the most recent coupon
payment.

bndconvp determines the convexity for a bond whether the first or last coupon periods in the coupon
structure are short or long (that is, whether the coupon structure is synchronized to maturity).
bndconvp also determines the convexity of a zero coupon bond. Convexity is a measure of the rate of
change in duration; measured in time. The greater the rate of change, the more the duration changes
as yield changes.

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvp( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional name-value
pair arguments.

Examples

Find Bond Convexity Given Price

This example shows how to compute the convexity of three bonds given their prices.

Price = [106; 100; 98]; 
CouponRate = 0.055; 
Settle = datetime(1999,8,2); 
Maturity = datetime(2004,6,15); 
Period = 2; 
Basis = 0;

[YearConvexity, PerConvexity] = bndconvp(Price,... 
CouponRate,Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis)

YearConvexity = 3×1

21.4447
   21.0363
   20.8951

PerConvexity = 3×1

85.7788
