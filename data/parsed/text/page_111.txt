The bright, central 3 x 3 square shows that in most transitions, tick to tick, no price change is
expected (ΔSfuture = 0). Bright areas in the upper-left 3 x 3 square (downward price movements
ΔSfuture = −1) and lower-right 3 x 3 square (upward price movements ΔSfuture = + 1) show evidence
of momentum, which can be leveraged in a trading strategy.

You can find arbitrage opportunities by thresholding Q above a specified trigger probability. For
example:

trigger = 0.5;
QPattern = (Q > trigger)

QPattern = 9×9 logical array

1   0   0   0   1   1   0   0   0
   1   1   0   0   0   1   0   0   0
   1   1   1   0   0   0   0   0   0
   0   0   0   1   1   1   0   0   0
   0   0   0   1   1   1   0   0   0
   0   0   0   1   1   1   0   0   0
   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   1   1
   0   0   0   1   0   0   0   1   1
   0   0   0   1   1   0   0   0   1

The entry in the (1,1) position shows a chance of more than 50% that a downward price movement
(ΔScurrent = −1) will be followed by another downward price movement (ΔSfuture = −1), provided
that the previous and current imbalance states ρ are both 1.

A Trading Strategy?

Q is constructed on the basis of both the available exchange data and the hyperparameter settings.
Using Q to inform future trading decisions depends on the market continuing in the same statistical
