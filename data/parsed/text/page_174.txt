where:

r0 is the risk-free rate (scalar).

m is the mean of asset returns (n vector).

b is the proportional cost to purchase assets (n vector).

s is the proportional cost to sell assets (n vector).

You can incorporate fixed transaction costs in this model also. Though in this case, it is necessary to
incorporate prices into such costs. The properties in the Portfolio object to specify net portfolio
returns are:

•
RiskFreeRate for r0
•
AssetMean for m

•
InitPort for x0
•
BuyCost for b

•
SellCost for s

Risk Proxy

The proxy for portfolio risk is a function σ: X
R on a portfolio set X ⊂Rn that characterizes the risks
associated with portfolio choices.

Mean Variance

The mean variance of portfolio returns for a portfolio x ∈X is

Variance x = xTCx

where C is the covariance of asset returns (n-by-n positive-semidefinite matrix).

The property in the Portfolio object to specify the variance of portfolio returns is AssetCovar for
C.

Although the risk proxy in mean-variance portfolio optimization is the variance of portfolio returns,
the square root, which is the standard deviation of portfolio returns, is often reported and displayed.
Moreover, this quantity is often called the “risk” of the portfolio. For details, see Markowitz (“Portfolio
Optimization” on page A-5).

Conditional Value-at-Risk

The conditional value-at-risk for a portfolio x ∈X, which is also known as expected shortfall, is
defined as

CVaRα x =
1
1 −α
∫
f(x, y) ≥VaRα(x)
f(x, y)p(y)dy,

where:

α is the probability level such that 0 < α < 1.
