Note  If input is scalar, UpperGroup undergoes scalar expansion to be conformable with
GroupMatrix.

Data Types: double

More About

Group Constraints

Group constraints specify that the total weight or allocation of assets within a particular group must
satisfy certain conditions relative to the total portfolio.

Group constraints help maintain diversification by preventing excessive concentration in specific
asset groups. They also align the portfolio with the investor's risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Tips

•
You can also use dot notation to add group constraints for portfolio weights.

obj = obj.addGroups(GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, UpperGroup)

•
To remove group constraints from any of the portfolio objects using dot notation, enter empty
arrays for the corresponding arrays.
