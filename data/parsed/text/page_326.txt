Even though the red dashed tangent line cuts off only a small piece of the graph, that small piece
already contains an important point, the global minima. In the worst case scenario, the Financial
Toolbox solvers compute the tangent line at a point that removes all minima of the function, like the
black dotted line does. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the type of function passed to a
Financial Toolbox solver.

All the above applies to minimization problems. Conversely, maximization problems with cardinality
constraints or conditional bounds can be solved by the Financial Toolbox solvers only if the functions
are concave.

Examples of Convex Functions

Here are some examples of common convex functions used in finance. You can use these convex
functions in minimization problems when using a Portfolio object with the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function:

•
Variance:

xTΣx

•
Tracking error:

(x −x0)TΣ(x −x0)

•
Herfindahl-Hirschman index:

xTx

•
Any linear function

•
Any positive combination of convex functions:

xTΣx + λ(xΣ(x −x0),  λ ≥0

xTΣx + λ1xTx + λ2(xΣ(x −x0),  λ1, λ2 ≥0
