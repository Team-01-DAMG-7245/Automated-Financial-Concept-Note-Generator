Adding or subtracting a scalar and a matrix is allowed and also operates element-by-element.

Multiplying Matrices

Matrix multiplication does not operate element-by-element. It operates according to the rules of
linear algebra. In multiplying matrices, it helps to remember this key rule: the inner dimensions must
be the same. That is, if the first matrix is m-by-3, the second must be 3-by-n. The resulting matrix is
m-by-n. It also helps to “talk through” the units of each matrix, as mentioned in “Analyze Sets of
Numbers Using Matrix Functions” on page 1-4.

Matrix multiplication also is not commutative; that is, it is not independent of order. A*B does not
equal B*A. The dimension rule illustrates this property. If A is 1-by-3 matrix and B is 3-by-1 matrix,
A*B yields a scalar (1-by-1) matrix but B*A yields a 3-by-3 matrix.

Multiplying Vectors

Vector multiplication follows the same rules and helps illustrate the principles. For example, a stock
portfolio has three different stocks and their closing prices today are:

ClosePrices = [42.5   15   78.875]

The portfolio contains these numbers of shares of each stock.

NumShares = [100
             500
             300]

To find the value of the portfolio, multiply the vectors

PortfValue = ClosePrices * NumShares

which yields:

PortfValue =

3.5413e+004

The vectors are 1-by-3 and 3-by-1; the resulting vector is 1-by-1, a scalar. Multiplying these vectors
thus means multiplying each closing price by its respective number of shares and summing the result.

To illustrate order dependence, switch the order of the vectors

Values = NumShares * ClosePrices

Values =

1.0e+004 *

0.4250    0.1500    0.7887
    2.1250    0.7500    3.9438
    1.2750    0.4500    2.3663
