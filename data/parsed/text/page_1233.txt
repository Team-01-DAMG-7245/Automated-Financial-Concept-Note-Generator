The simByEuler Euler approximation literally evaluates the stochastic differential equation directly
from the equation of motion, for some suitable value of the dt time increment. This simple
approximation suffers from discretization error. This error is attributed to the discrepancy between
the choice of the dt time increment and what in theory is a continuous-time parameter.

The discrete-time approximation improves as DeltaTime approaches zero. The Euler method is often
the least accurate and most general method available. All models shipped in the simulation suite have
this method.

In contrast, the simBySolution method provides a more accurate description of the underlying
model. This method simulates the price paths by an approximation of the closed-form solution of
separable models. Specifically, it applies a Euler approach to a transformed process, which in general
is not the exact solution to this GBM model. This is because the probability distributions of the
simulated and true state vectors are identical only for piecewise constant parameters.

When all model parameters are piecewise constant over each observation period, the simulated
process is exact for the observation times at which the state vector is sampled. Since all parameters
are constants in this example, simBySolution does indeed sample the exact solution.

For an example of how to use simBySolution to optimize the accuracy of solutions, see “Optimizing
Accuracy: About Solution Precision and Error” on page 14-66.

Induce Dependence and Correlation Between States

This example illustrates two techniques that induce dependence between individual elements of a
state vector. It also illustrates the interaction between Sigma and Correlation.
