For both types of portfolios, mean-variance and CVaR, the portfolio with the maximum expected
return is the one that allocates all the weight to the stock-only strategy. This makes sense because no
put options are acquired, which translates into larger returns. Also, the portfolio with minimum
variance is the same for both risk measures. This portfolio is the one that allocates everything to
'Hedge95' because that strategy limits the possible losses the most. The real differences between
the two types of portfolios are observed for the return levels between the minimum and maximum.
There, in contrast to the efficient portfolios obtained using variance as the measure of risk, the
weights of the CVaR portfolios range among all five possible strategies.
