Data Types: double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer 0 or 1

End-of-month rule flag, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'EndMonthRule' and a
nonnegative integer, 0 or 1, using a NINST-by-1 vector. This rule applies only when Maturity is an
end-of-month date for a month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the same numerical day of
the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the last actual day of the
month.

Data Types: double

IssueDate — Bond issue date
if IssueDate not specified, cash flow payment dates determined from other inputs (default) |
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Bond issue date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'IssueDate' and a N-by-1
vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

Data Types: char | datetime | string

FirstCouponDate — First actual coupon date
if you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, cash flow payment dates are determined from other
inputs (default) | datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

First actual coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'FirstCouponDate'
and a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. FirstCouponDate is used when a bond has
an irregular first coupon period. When FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified,
FirstCouponDate takes precedence in determining the coupon payment structure.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

Data Types: char | datetime | string

LastCouponDate — Last actual coupon date
if you do not specify a LastCouponDate, cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs
(default) | datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector
