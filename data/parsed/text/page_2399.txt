vector

Vector to form linear equality constraints, returned as a vector for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

More About

Equality Constraint

An equality constraint requires certain conditions to be met exactly, rather than allowing for a range
of values.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to obtain the equality constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

[AEquality, bEquality] = obj.getEquality;
