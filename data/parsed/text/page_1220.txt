Although the sdemrd and cir objects are of different classes, they represent the same mathematical
model. They differ in that you create the cir object by specifying only three input arguments. This
distinction is reinforced by the fact that the Alpha parameter does not display – it is defined to be
1/2.

Creating Hull-White/Vasicek (HWV) Gaussian Diffusion Models

The Hull-White/Vasicek (HWV) short-rate object, hwv, derives directly from SDE with mean-reverting
drift (sdemrd) class:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + V(t)dWt

Specify Hull-White/Vasicek Gaussian Diffusion Model

Using the same parameters as in “Specify Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Square Root Diffusion Model” on page
14-27, create an hwv object using hwv to represent the model:

obj = hwv(0.2, 0.1, 0.05)  % (Speed, Level, Sigma)

obj =

cir and hwv share the same interface and display methods. The only distinction is that cir and hwv
model objects constrain Alpha exponents to 1/2 and 0, respectively. Furthermore, the hwv object
also provides an additional method that simulates approximate analytic solutions (simBySolution)
of separable models.

The simBySolution method simulates the state vector Xtusing an approximation of the closed-form
solution of diagonal drift HWV models. Each element of the state vector Xtis expressed as the sum of
NBrowns correlated Gaussian random draws added to a deterministic time-variable drift.

When evaluating expressions, all model parameters are assumed piecewise constant over each
simulation period. In general, this is not the exact solution to this hwv model, because the probability
