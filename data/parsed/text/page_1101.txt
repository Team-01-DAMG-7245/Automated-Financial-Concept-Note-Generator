Shift Yield Curve

Choose a hypothetical amount by which to shift the yield curve (here, 0.2 percentage point or 20
basis points).

dY = 0.002;

Weight the three bonds equally, and calculate the actual quantity of each bond in the portfolio, which
has a total value of $100,000.

PortfolioPrice   = 100000;
PortfolioWeights = ones(3,1)/3;
PortfolioAmounts = PortfolioPrice * PortfolioWeights ./ Prices

PortfolioAmounts = 3×1

Calculate Modified Duration and Convexity for Portfolio

Calculate the modified duration and convexity of the portfolio. The portfolio duration or convexity is a
weighted average of the durations or convexities of the individual bonds. Calculate the first- and
second-order approximations of the percent price change as a function of the change in the level of
interest rates.

PortfolioDuration  = PortfolioWeights' * Durations;
PortfolioConvexity = PortfolioWeights' * Convexities;
PercentApprox1 = -PortfolioDuration * dY * 100

PercentApprox1 = 
-2.0636

PercentApprox2 =  PercentApprox1 + ...
PortfolioConvexity*dY^2*100/2.0

PercentApprox2 = 
-2.0321

Estimate Portfolio Price

Estimate the new portfolio price using the two estimates for the percent price change.

PriceApprox1  =  PortfolioPrice + ... 
PercentApprox1 * PortfolioPrice/100

PriceApprox1 =
