These points concern how Design handles missing data:

•
Although Design should not have NaN values, ignored samples due to NaN values in Data are also
ignored in the corresponding Design array.

•
If Design is a 1-by-1 cell array, which has a single Design matrix for each sample, no NaN values
are permitted in the array. A model with this structure must have NUMSERIES ≥ NUMPARAMS with
rank(Design{1}) = NUMPARAMS.

•
ecmlsrmle is more strict than mvnrmle about the presence of NaN values in the Design array.

Data Types: double | cell

MaxIterations — Maximum number of iterations for the estimation algorithm
100 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Maximum number of iterations for the estimation algorithm, specified as a numeric. The
default value is 100.

Data Types: double

TolParam — Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm
sqrt(eps) (default) | numeric

(Optional) Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in model parameter
estimates, specified as a numeric. The Default value is sqrt(eps) which is about 1.0e-8 for double
precision. The convergence test for changes in model parameters is

Paramk −Paramk −1 < TolParam × 1 + Paramk

where Param represents the output Parameters, and iteration k = 2, 3, ... . Convergence is assumed
when both the TolParam and TolObj conditions are satisfied. If both TolParam ≤ 0 and TolObj ≤
0, do the maximum number of iterations (MaxIterations), whatever the results of the convergence
tests.

TolObj — Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in objective
function
eps ∧ 3/4 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in the objective
function, specified as a numeric. The default value is eps ∧ 3/4 which is about 1.0e-12 for double
precision. The convergence test for changes in the objective function is

Ob jk −Ob jk −1 < TolOb j × 1 + Ob jk

for iteration k = 2, 3, ... . Convergence is assumed when both the TolParam and TolObj conditions
are satisfied. If both TolParam ≤ 0 and TolObj ≤ 0, do the maximum number of iterations
(MaxIterations), whatever the results of the convergence tests.

Param0 — User-supplied initial estimate for the parameters of regression model
zero vector (default) | vector

(Optional) User-supplied initial estimate for the parameters of the regression model, specified as an
NUMPARAMS-by-1 column vector.
