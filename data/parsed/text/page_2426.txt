holdings2weights

Portfolio holdings into weights

Syntax

Weights = holdings2weights(Holdings,Prices)
Weights = holdings2weights( ___ ,Budget)

Description

Weights = holdings2weights(Holdings,Prices) converts portfolio holdings into portfolio
weights. The weights must satisfy a budget constraint such that the weights sum to Budget for each
portfolio.

Weights = holdings2weights( ___ ,Budget) converts portfolio holdings into portfolio weights
using an optional argument for Budget.

Input Arguments

Holdings — Holdings value
matrix

Holdings value, returned as an NPORTS-by-NASSETS matrix that contains the holdings of NPORTS
portfolios that contain NASSETS assets.

Note

•
Holdings may be negative to indicate a short position, but the overall portfolio weights must
satisfy a nonzero budget constraint.

•
The weights in each portfolio sum to the Budget value (which is 1 if Budget is unspecified.)
