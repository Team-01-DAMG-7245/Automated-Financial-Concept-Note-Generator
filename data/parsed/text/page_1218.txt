•
An overloaded Euler simulation method that improves run-time performance in certain common
situations. This specialized method is invoked automatically only if all the following conditions are
true:

•
The expected rate of return (Return) is a diagonal matrix.

•
The volatility rate (Sigma) is a matrix.

•
No end-of-period adjustments/processes are made.

•
If specified, the random noise process Z is a three-dimensional array.

•
If Z is unspecified, the assumed Gaussian correlation structure is a double matrix.

•
An approximate analytic solution (simBySolution) obtained by applying a Euler approach to the
transformed (using Ito's formula) logarithmic process. In general, this is not the exact solution to
this GBM model, as the probability distributions of the simulated and true state vectors are
identical only for piecewise constant parameters. If the model parameters are piecewise constant
over each observation period, the state vector Xt is lognormally distributed and the simulated
process is exact for the observation times at which Xt is sampled.

Specify Univariate Geometric Brownian Motion Model

Create a univariate gbm object to represent the model using gbm. The gbm model allows the
simulation of vector-valued GBM processes of the form:

obj = gbm(0.25, 0.3)  % (B = Return, Sigma)

obj =

Creating Stochastic Differential Equations from Mean-Reverting Drift
(SDEMRD) Models

The sdemrd object derives directly from the sdeddo object. It provides an interface in which the
drift-rate function is expressed in mean-reverting drift form:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt

sdemrd objects provide a parametric alternative to the linear drift form by reparameterizing the
general linear drift such that:

A(t) = S(t)L(t), B(t) = −S(t)
