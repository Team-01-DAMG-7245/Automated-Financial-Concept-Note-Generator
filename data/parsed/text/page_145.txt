Introduction

One of the factors to consider when selecting the optimal portfolio for a particular investor is the
degree of risk aversion. This level of aversion to risk can be characterized by defining the investor's
indifference curve. This curve consists of the family of risk/return pairs defining the trade-off between
the expected return and the risk. It establishes the increment in return that a particular investor
requires to make an increment in risk worthwhile. Typical risk aversion coefficients range from 2.0
through 4.0, with the higher number representing lesser tolerance to risk. The equation used to
represent risk aversion in Financial Toolbox software is

U = E(r) - 0.005*A*sig^2

where:

U is the utility value.

E(r) is the expected return.

A is the index of investor's aversion.

sig is the standard deviation.

Note An alternative to using these portfolio optimization functions is to use the Portfolio object
(Portfolio) for mean-variance portfolio optimization. This object supports gross or net portfolio
