is a sampling step, to produce a training set, sometimes called the modeling view, and usually a
validation set, too. The training set, in the form of a table, is the required data input to the
creditscorecard object, and this training set table must be prepared before creating a
creditscorecard object in the Modeling phase.

2
Modeling phase

Use the creditscorecard object and associated object functions to develop a credit scorecard
model. You can bin the data, apply the Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation, and compute
other statistics, such as the Information Value. You can fit a logistic regression model and also
review the resulting scorecard points and format their scaling and rounding. For details on using
the creditscorecard object, see creditscorecard.

3
Deployment phase

Deployment entails integrating a credit scorecard model into an IT production environment and
keeping tracking logs, performance reports, and so on.

The creditscorecard object is designed for the Modeling phase of the credit scorecard workflow.
Support for all three phases requires other MathWorks products.
