Mixed-Integer Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization Problem

This example shows how to solve a mean-variance portfolio optimization problem with constraints in
the number of selected assets or conditional (semicontinuous) bounds. To solve this problem, you can
use a Portfolio object along with different mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solvers.

Mean-Variance Portfolio

Load the returns data in CAPMuniverse.mat. Then, create a mean-variance Portfolio object with
default constraints and a long-only portfolio whose weights sum to 1. For this example, you can define
the feasible region of weights X as

X =
x| ∑
i = 1

n
xi = 1, xi ≥0 .

% Load data
load CAPMuniverse.mat

% Create a mean-variance Portfolio object with default constraints.
p = Portfolio(AssetList=Assets(1:12));
p = estimateAssetMoments(p,Data(:,1:12));
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

Include binary variables for this scenario by setting conditional (semicontinuous) bounds. Conditional
bounds are those such that xi = 0 or xi ≥ℓi. In this example, ℓi = 0 . 1 for all assets.

% Set conditional bounds
condLB = 0.1;
condUB = 0.5;
p = setBounds(p,condLB,condUB,BoundType="conditional");

Use estimateFrontier to estimate a set of portfolios on the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier
is a curve that shows the trade-off between the return and risk achieved by Pareto-optimal portfolios.
For a given return level, the portfolio on the efficient frontier is the one that minimizes the risk while
maintaining the desired return. Conversely, for a given risk level, the portfolio on the efficient frontier
is the one that maximizes return while maintaining the desired risk level.

% Compute the efficient frontier.
pwgt = estimateFrontier(p)

pwgt = 12×10
