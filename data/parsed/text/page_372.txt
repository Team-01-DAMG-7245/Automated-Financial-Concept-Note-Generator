Calculate historical statistics and plot the annual risk-return. Note that the plot is at the annual level,
therefore scaling is performed on the daily returns.

scale = 252;

assetRiskR = sqrt(scale) * assetRisk;
benchRiskR = sqrt(scale) * benchRisk;
assetReturnR = scale * assetRetn;
benchReturnR = scale * benchRetn;

Set Up a Portfolio Optimization

Set up a portfolio optimization problem by populating the object using Portfolio. Because the goal
is to optimize portfolio allocation against a benchmark, the active return of each asset is computed
