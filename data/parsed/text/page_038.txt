there must be two equations, which there are. Matrix algebra represents this system as an equation
involving three matrices: A for the left-side constants, X for the variables, and B for the right-side
constants

A = 2
1
1 −3 ,     X = x
y ,     B =
13
−18 ,

where A*X = B.

Solving the system simultaneously means solving for X. Using MATLAB,

A = [2  1
     1 -3];

B = [13
    -18];

X = A \ B

solves for X in A * X = B.

X = [3 7]

So x = 3 and y = 7 in this example. In general, you can use matrix algebra to solve any system of
linear equations such as

a11x1 + a12x2 + … + a1nxn = b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + … + a2nxn = b2
⋮
am1x1 + am2x2 + … + amnxn = bm

by representing them as matrices

A =

a11 a12 ⋯a1n
a21 a22 ⋯a2n
⋮
⋮
⋮

am1 am2 ⋯amn

,      X =

x1
x2
⋮
xn

,      B =

b1
b2
⋮
bm

and solving for X in A*X = B.

To illustrate, consider this situation. There are two portfolios of mortgage-based instruments, M1 and
M2. They have current annual cash payments of $100 and $70 per unit, respectively, based on today's
prime rate. If the prime rate moves down one percentage point, their payments would be $80 and
$40. An investor holds 10 units of M1 and 20 units of M2. The investor's receipts equal cash
payments times units, or R = C * U, for each prime-rate scenario. As word equations:

M1
M2

Prime flat:
$100 * 10 units
+ $70 * 20 units = $2400
receipts

Prime down:
$80 * 10 units
+ $40 * 20 units = $1600
receipts
