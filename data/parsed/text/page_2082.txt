Last coupon date of a bond before maturity date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

LastCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular last coupon period. In the absence of a
specified FirstCouponDate, a specified LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the
bond. The coupon structure of a bond is truncated at the LastCouponDate, regardless of where it
falls, and is followed only by the bond's maturity cash flow date. If you do not specify a
LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndaysn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

NumDaysNext — Number of days from settlement date to next coupon date
vector

Number of days from settlement date to next coupon date, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector. For
zero coupon bonds coupon dates are computed as if the bonds have a semiannual coupon structure.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cpndaysn supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
