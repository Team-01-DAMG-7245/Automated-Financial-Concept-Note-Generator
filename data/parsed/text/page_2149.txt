More About

Fixed Declining-Balance Depreciation Schedule

A fixed declining-balance depreciation schedule is a method of calculating depreciation that applies a
constant percentage rate to the book value of an asset at the beginning of each accounting period.

This approach results in a larger depreciation expense in the earlier years of the asset's life,
gradually decreasing the expense in subsequent years. It is particularly useful for assets that are
expected to lose value more quickly in their initial years of usage.
