Working with 'Simple' Bound Constraints Using Portfolio Object

'Simple' bound constraints are optional linear constraints that maintain upper and lower bounds on
portfolio weights (see “'Simple' Bound Constraints” on page 4-10). Although every portfolio set must
be bounded, it is not necessary to specify a portfolio set with explicit bound constraints. For example,
you can create a portfolio set with an implicit upper bound constraint or a portfolio set with average
turnover constraints. The bound constraints have properties LowerBound for the lower-bound
constraint and UpperBound for the upper-bound constraint. Set default values for these constraints
using the setDefaultConstraints function (see “Setting Default Constraints for Portfolio Weights
Using Portfolio Object” on page 4-58).

Setting 'Simple' Bounds Using the Portfolio Function

The properties for bound constraints are set through the Portfolio object. Suppose that you have a
balanced fund with stocks that can range from 50% to 75% of your portfolio and bonds that can range
from 25% to 50% of your portfolio. The bound constraints for a balanced fund are set with:

lb = [ 0.5; 0.25 ];
ub = [ 0.75; 0.5 ];
p = Portfolio('LowerBound', lb, 'UpperBound', ub, 'BoundType', 'Simple');
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.LowerBound)
disp(p.UpperBound)

To continue with this example, you must set up a budget constraint. For details, see “Working with
Budget Constraints Using Portfolio Object” on page 4-65.

Setting 'Simple' Bounds Using the setBounds Function

You can also set the properties for bound constraints using setBounds. Suppose that you have a
balanced fund with stocks that can range from 50% to 75% of your portfolio and bonds that can range
from 25% to 50% of your portfolio. Given a Portfolio object p, use setBounds to set the bound
constraints:

lb = [ 0.5; 0.25 ];
ub = [ 0.75; 0.5 ];
p = Portfolio;
p = setBounds(p, lb, ub,'BoundType', 'Simple');
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.LowerBound)
disp(p.UpperBound)
