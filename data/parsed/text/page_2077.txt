FirstCouponDate — Date when bond makes first coupon payment
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Date when a bond makes its first coupon payment, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

FirstCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular first coupon period. When
FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified, FirstCouponDate takes precedence
in determining the coupon payment structure. If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash
flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndatep also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Last coupon date of bond before maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Last coupon date of a bond before maturity date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

LastCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular last coupon period. In the absence of a
specified FirstCouponDate, a specified LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the
bond. The coupon structure of a bond is truncated at the LastCouponDate, regardless of where it
falls, and is followed only by the bond's maturity cash flow date. If you do not specify a
LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndatep also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

PreviousCouponDate — Previous coupon date on or before settlement for portfolio of
bonds
vector

Previous coupon date on or before settlement for portfolio of bonds, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-1
vector. If settlement is a coupon date, this function returns the settlement date. The actual coupon
date strictly on or before settlement is returned, but not exceeding the issue date, if available. Thus,
this function always returns the lesser of the actual issue date and the previous coupon payment date
with respect to the settlement date.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then PreviousCouponDate is returned as a serial date
number. Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted datetime arrays.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then PreviousCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.
