12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If a SIA day-count basis is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value assigned
for DiscountBasis, the default behavior is for SIA bases to use the actual/actual day count to
compute discount factors.

If an ICMA day-count basis or BUS/252 is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value
assigned for DiscountBasis, the specified bases from the Basis input argument are used.

LastCouponInterest — Compounding convention for computing yield of a bond in last
coupon period
compound (default) | values are simple or compound

•
simple

•
compound

Data Types: char | cell

returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

YearDuration — Macaulay duration in years
numeric

Macaulay duration in years, returned as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector.

PerDuration — Periodic Macaulay duration
numeric
