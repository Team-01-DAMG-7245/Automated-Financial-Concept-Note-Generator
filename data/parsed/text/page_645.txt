•
At the endpoints of the efficient frontier

•
That attain targeted values for return proxies

•
That attain targeted values for risk proxies

•
Along the entire efficient frontier

These functions also provide purchases and sales needed to shift from an initial or current portfolio to
each efficient portfolio. At the efficient frontier level, a collection of functions plot the efficient
frontier and estimate either risk or return proxies for efficient portfolios on the efficient frontier. You
can use the resultant efficient portfolios or risk and return proxies in subsequent analyses.

Arrays of PortfolioCVaR Objects

Although all functions associated with a PortfolioCVaR object are designed to work on a scalar
PortfolioCVaR object, the array capabilities of MATLAB enables you to set up and work with arrays
of PortfolioCVaR objects. The easiest way to do this is with the repmat function. For example, to
create a 3-by-2 array of PortfolioCVaR objects:

p = repmat(PortfolioCVaR, 3, 2);
disp(p)

3×2 PortfolioCVaR array with properties:

BuyCost
    SellCost
    RiskFreeRate
    ProbabilityLevel
    Turnover
    BuyTurnover
    SellTurnover
