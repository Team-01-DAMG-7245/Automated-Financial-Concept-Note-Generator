Bond Portfolio for Hedging Duration and Convexity

This example shows how to construct a bond portfolio to hedge a portfolio of bonds.

The code in this example constructs a bond portfolio to hedge the portfolio of “Sensitivity of Bond
Prices to Interest Rates” on page 10-2. It assumes a long position in (holding) the portfolio, and that
three other bonds are available for hedging. It chooses weights for these three other bonds in a new
portfolio so that the duration and convexity of the new portfolio match those of the original portfolio.
Taking a short position in the new portfolio, in an amount equal to the value of the first portfolio,
partially hedges against parallel shifts in the yield curve.

Recall that portfolio duration or convexity is a weighted average of the durations or convexities of the
individual bonds in a portfolio. As in the previous example, this example uses modified duration in
years and convexity in years. The hedging problem therefore becomes one of solving a system of
linear equations, which is an easy thing to do in MATLAB® software.

Define Bonds

Define three bonds available for hedging the original portfolio. Specify values for the settlement date,
maturity date, face value, and coupon rate. For simplicity, accept default values for the coupon
payment periodicity (semiannual), end-of-month payment rule (rule in effect), and day-count basis
(actual/actual). Also, synchronize the coupon payment structure to the maturity date (that is, no odd
first or last coupon dates). Set any inputs for which defaults are accepted to empty matrices ([]) as
placeholders where appropriate. The intent is to hedge against duration and convexity and constrain
total portfolio price.

Settle     = '19-Aug-1999';
Maturity   = ['15-Jun-2005'; '02-Oct-2010'; '01-Mar-2025'];
Face       = [500; 1000; 250];
CouponRate = [0.07; 0.066; 0.08];

Specify the yield curve for each bond.

Yields = [0.06; 0.07; 0.075];

Calculate Price, Modified Duration, and Convexity for Each Bond

Calculate the price, modified duration in years, and convexity in years of each bond.

[CleanPrice, AccruedInterest] = bndprice(Yields,CouponRate,... 
Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, [], [], [], [], [], Face);

Durations = bnddury(Yields, CouponRate, Settle, Maturity,...
2, 0, [], [], [], [], [], Face);

Convexities = bndconvy(Yields, CouponRate, Settle,... 
Maturity, 2, 0, [], [], [], [], [], Face);

Prices  =  CleanPrice + AccruedInterest

Prices = 3×1
