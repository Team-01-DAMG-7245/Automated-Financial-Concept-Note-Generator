Valuing an Existing CDS Contract

This example shows how to compute the current value, or mark-to-market, of an existing CDS
contract. The current value is the amount of money the contract holder would receive (if positive) or
pay (if negative) to unwind the contract.

The upfront of the contract is the current value expressed as a fraction of the notional amount of the
contract, and it is commonly used to quote market values.

The value of existing CDS contracts is obtained with cdsprice. By default, cdsprice treats
contracts as long positions. Whether a contract position is long or short is determined from a
protection standpoint, that is, long means that protection was bought, and short means protection
was sold. In the following code, an existing CDS contract pays a premium that is lower than current
market conditions. The price is positive, as expected, since it would be more costly to buy the same
type of protection today.

Settle = '17-Jul-2009';   % Valuation date for the CDS
MarketDates = datenum({'20-Sep-10','20-Sep-11','20-Sep-12','20-Sep-14', ...
'20-Sep-16'});
MarketSpreads = [140 175 210 265 310]';
MarketData = [MarketDates MarketSpreads];

ZeroDates = datenum({'17-Jan-10','17-Jul-10','17-Jul-11','17-Jul-12', ...
'17-Jul-13','17-Jul-14'});
ZeroRates = [1.35 1.43 1.9 2.47 2.936 3.311]'/100;
ZeroData = [ZeroDates ZeroRates];

[ProbData,HazData] = cdsbootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle);

Maturity2 = '20-Sep-2012';
Spread2 = 196;
 
[Price,AccPrem,PaymentDates,PaymentTimes,PaymentCF] = cdsprice(ZeroData, ...
ProbData,Settle,Maturity2,Spread2);
 
fprintf('Dirty Price: %8.2f\n',Price+AccPrem);

Dirty Price: 56872.94

fprintf('Accrued Premium: %8.2f\n',AccPrem);

Accrued Premium: 15244.44

fprintf('Clean Price: %8.2f\n',Price);

Clean Price: 41628.50

fprintf('\nPayment Schedule:\n\n');

Payment Schedule:

fprintf('Date \t\t Time Frac \t Amount\n');

Date          Time Frac      Amount

for k = 1:length(PaymentDates)
   fprintf('%s \t %5.4f \t %8.2f\n',datestr(PaymentDates(k)), ...
