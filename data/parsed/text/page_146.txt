Optimal Risky Portfolio

This example shows how to compute the optimal risky portfolio on the efficient frontier based on the
risk-free rate, the borrowing rate, and the investor's degree of risk aversion.

You do this with the function portalloc. First generate the efficient frontier data using portopt.

ExpReturn = [0.1 0.2 0.15];

ExpCovariance  = [ 0.005   -0.010    0.004;
                  -0.010    0.040   -0.002;
                   0.004   -0.002    0.023];

NumPorts = 20; % Consider 20 different points along the efficient frontier.

[PortRisk, PortReturn, PortWts] = portopt(ExpReturn,... 
ExpCovariance, NumPorts);

Calling portopt, while specifying output arguments, returns the corresponding vectors and arrays
representing the risk, return, and weights for each of the portfolios along the efficient frontier. Use
these as the first three input arguments to the function portalloc.

Find the optimal risky portfolio and the optimal allocation of funds between the risky portfolio and
the risk-free asset, using these values for the risk-free rate, borrowing rate, and investor's degree of
risk aversion.

RisklessRate  =  0.08

RisklessRate = 
0.0800

BorrowRate    =  0.12

BorrowRate = 
0.1200

RiskAversion  =  3

RiskAversion = 
3

portalloc(PortRisk, PortReturn, PortWts, RisklessRate,... 
BorrowRate, RiskAversion);
