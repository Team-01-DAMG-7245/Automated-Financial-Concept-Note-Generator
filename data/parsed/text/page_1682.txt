Perform a quasi-Monte Carlo simulation by using simByQuadExp with the optional name-value
arguments for 'MonteCarloMethod','QuasiSequence', and 'BrownianMotionMethod'.

[paths,time,z] = simByQuadExp(Bates,10,'ntrials',4096,'montecarlomethod','quasi','quasisequence',

Input Arguments

MDL — Stochastic differential equation model
bates object | heston object | cir object

Stochastic differential equation model, specified as a bates, heston, or cir object. You can create
these objects using bates, heston, or cir.

Data Types: object

NPeriods — Number of simulation periods
positive scalar integer

Number of simulation periods, specified as a positive scalar integer. The value of NPeriods
determines the number of rows of the simulated output series.

Data Types: double

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [Paths,Times,Z,N] = simByQuadExp(bates_obj,NPeriods,'DeltaTime',dt)

NTrials — Simulated trials (sample paths) of NPeriods observations each
1 (single path of correlated state variables) (default) | positive scalar integer

Simulated trials (sample paths) of NPeriods observations each, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'NTrials' and a positive scalar integer.

Data Types: double

DeltaTime — Positive time increments between observations
1 (default) | scalar | column vector

Positive time increments between observations, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'DeltaTime' and a scalar or a NPeriods-by-1 column vector.

DeltaTime represents the familiar dt found in stochastic differential equations, and determines the
times at which the simulated paths of the output state variables are reported.

Data Types: double

NSteps — Number of intermediate time steps within each time increment dt (specified as
DeltaTime)
1 (indicating no intermediate evaluation) (default) | positive scalar integer
