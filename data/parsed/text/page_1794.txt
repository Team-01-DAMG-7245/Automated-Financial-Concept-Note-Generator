blsgamma

Black-Scholes sensitivity to underlying delta change

Syntax

Gamma = blsgamma(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
Gamma = blsgamma( ___ ,Yield)

Description

Gamma = blsgamma(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns gamma, the sensitivity of
delta to change in the underlying asset price. blsgamma uses normpdf, the probability density
function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and gamma values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blsgamma can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

Gamma = blsgamma( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Find Gamma for a Change in the Underlying Asset Price

This example shows how to find the gamma, the sensitivity of delta to a change in the underlying
asset price.

Gamma = blsgamma(50, 50, 0.12, 0.25, 0.3, 0)

Gamma = 
0.0512
