Cash-flow duration and modified duration

Syntax

[Duration,ModDuration] = cfdur(CashFlow,Yield)

Description

[Duration,ModDuration] = cfdur(CashFlow,Yield) calculates the duration and modified
duration of a cash flow in periods.

Examples

Compute the Duration and Modified Duration of a Cash Flow

This example shows how to calculate the duration and modified duration of a cash flow, given a cash
flow of nine payments of $2.50 and a final payment $102.50, with a periodic yield of 2.5%.

CashFlow=[2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 102.5];

[Duration, ModDuration] = cfdur(CashFlow, 0.025)

Duration = 
8.9709

ModDuration = 
8.7521
