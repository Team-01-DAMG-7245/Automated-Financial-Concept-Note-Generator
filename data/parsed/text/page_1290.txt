You might expect the volatility in the commodities to manifest itself in the irregular component,
rather than the regular component. For this reason, continue with the clusters identified by
performing hierarchical clustering on the irregular components of the commodity price series.
However, clustering on the regular components provides a useful grouping of the commodities based
on their combined long-term and seasonal trends. From the dendrogram, you can see that both
oranges and bananas have a dissimilar regular profile to the other commodities.

Visualize Clusters in 3D

Embed the commodities in a lower-dimensional space by using classical multi-dimensional scaling
using cmdscale.

lowerDim = 3;
Y = cmdscale( irregularCorrDistances, lowerDim );

Visualize the embedding. Add the convex hull of each group using convhull to illustrate the
different groupings in 3-dimensional space.

view( 3 )
clusterColors = hsv( numClusters );
colormap( clusterColors )
hold( "on" )

for k = 1:numClusters
    % Extract coordinate data for the current group.
    idx = clusteredCommodities.Group == k;
    clusterx = Y(idx, 1);
