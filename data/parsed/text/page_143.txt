Introduction

The efficient frontier computation functions require information about each asset in the portfolio.
This data is entered into the function via two matrices: an expected return vector and a covariance
matrix. The expected return vector contains the average expected return for each asset in the
portfolio. The covariance matrix is a square matrix representing the interrelationships between pairs
of assets. This information can be directly specified or can be estimated from an asset return time
series with the function ewstats.

Note An alternative to using these portfolio optimization functions is to use the Portfolio object
(Portfolio) for mean-variance portfolio optimization. This object supports gross or net portfolio
returns as the return proxy, the variance of portfolio returns as the risk proxy, and a portfolio set that
is any combination of the specified constraints to form a portfolio set. For information on the
workflow when using Portfolio objects, see “Portfolio Object Workflow” on page 4-18.
