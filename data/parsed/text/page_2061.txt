Date when a bond makes its first coupon payment, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

FirstCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular first coupon period. When
FirstCouponDate and LastCouponDate are both specified, FirstCouponDate takes precedence
in determining the coupon payment structure. If you do not specify a FirstCouponDate, the cash
flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndaten also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

LastCouponDate — Last coupon date of bond before maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Last coupon date of a bond before maturity date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

LastCouponDate is used when a bond has an irregular last coupon period. In the absence of a
specified FirstCouponDate, a specified LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the
bond. The coupon structure of a bond is truncated at the LastCouponDate, regardless of where it
falls, and is followed only by the bond's maturity cash flow date. If you do not specify a
LastCouponDate, the cash flow payment dates are determined from other inputs.

To support existing code, cpndaten also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

NextCouponDate — Next coupon date after the settlement date
vector

Next coupon date after the settlement date, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of next actual
coupon dates after settlement. If settlement is a coupon date, this function never returns the
settlement date. Instead, the actual coupon date strictly after settlement is returned, but not
exceeding the maturity date. Thus, this function will always return the lesser of the actual maturity
date and the next coupon payment date.

If all the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are
either strings or date character vectors, then NextCouponDate is returned as a serial date number.
Use the function datetime to convert serial date numbers to formatted date character vectors.

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then NextCouponDate is returned as a datetime array.
