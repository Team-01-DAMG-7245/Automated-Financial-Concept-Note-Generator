Building Predictors Using Credit Ratings Data

Using the credit data, you can build new time series of interest. Start with an age proxy that is used
as predictor in the forecasting model in the second part of this example.

Age is known to be an important factor in predicting default rates; see, for example, [1 on page 8-
42] and [5 on page 8-43]. Age here means the number of years since a bond was issued. By
extension, the age of a portfolio is the average age of its bonds. Certain patterns have been observed
historically. Many low-quality borrowers default just a few years after issuing a bond. When troubled
companies issue bonds, the amount borrowed helps them make payments for a year or two. Beyond
that point, their only source of money is their cash flows, and if they are insufficient, default occurs.

You cannot calculate the exact age of the portfolio, because there is no information at issuer level in
the dataset. This example follows [6 on page 8-43], however, and uses the number of new issuers in
year t-3 divided by the total number of issuers at the end of year t as an age proxy. Because of the lag,
the age proxy starts in 1984. For the numerator, you have explicit information on the number of new
issuers. For the denominator, the number of issuers at the end of a year equals the number of issuers
at the beginning of next year. This is known for all years but the last one, which is set to the total
transitions into a non-default rating plus the number of new issuers on that year.

% Total number of issuers at the end of the year
nEOY = zeros(nYears,1);
% nIssuers is number of issuers per ratings at the beginning of the year
% nEOY ( 1981 ) = sum nIssuers ( 1982 ), etc until 2004
nEOY(1:end-1) = sum(nIssuers(2:end,:),2);
% nEOY ( 2005 ) = issuers in non-default state at end of 2005 plus
% new issuers in 2005
nEOY(end) = totalsAll(end).totalsMat(1,1) + sum(nNewIssuers(end,:));
% Age proxy
AGE = 100*[nan(3,1); sum(nNewIssuers(1:end-3,:),2)./nEOY(4:end)];

Examples of other time series of interest are the proportion of SG issuers at the end of each year, or
an age proxy for SG.

% nSGEOY: Number of SG issuers at the end of the year
% nSGEOY is similar to nEOY, but for SG only, from 5 ('BB') to 7 ('CCC')
indSG = 5:7;
nSGEOY = zeros(nYears,1);
nSGEOY(1:end-1) = sum(nIssuers(2:end,indSG),2);
nSGEOY(end) = sum(totalsIGSG(end).totalsMat(:,2)) + ...
   sum(nNewIssuers(end,indSG));
% Proportion of SG issuers
SG = 100*nSGEOY./nEOY;
% SG age proxy: new SG issuers in t-3 / total issuers at the end of year t
AGESG = 100*[nan(3,1); sum(nNewIssuers(1:end-3,indSG),2)./nEOY(4:end)];

Part II: A Forecasting Model for Default Rates

This example works with the following linear regression model for corporate default rates

Def Rate = β0 + βageAGE + βcpfCPF + βsprSPR
