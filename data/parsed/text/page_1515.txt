Algorithms

The Merton jump diffusion model (Merton 1976) is an extension of the Black-Scholes model, and
models sudden asset price movements (both up and down) by adding the jump diffusion parameters
with the Poisson process Pt.

Under the risk-neutral measure the model is expressed as follows

dSt = (γ −q −λpμj)Stdt + σMStdWt + JStdPt
prob(dPt = 1) = λpdt

Here:

ᵞ is the continuous risk-free rate.

q is the continuous dividend yield.

J is the random percentage jump size conditional on the jump occurring, where

ln(1 + J) N(ln(1+uj) −δ2

2 , δ2

(1+J) has a lognormal distribution:
