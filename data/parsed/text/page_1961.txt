Input Arguments

values — 3-D array of simulated mark-to-market values of portfolio of contracts
array

3-D array of simulated mark-to-market values of a portfolio of contracts simulated over a series of
simulation dates and across many scenarios, specified as a NumDates-by-NumContracts-by-
NumScenarios “cube” of contract values. Each row represents a different simulation date, each
column a different contract, and each “page” is a different scenario from a Monte-Carlo simulation.

Data Types: double

counterparties — Counterparties corresponding to each contract
vector | cell array

Counterparties corresponding to each contract in values, specified as a NumContracts-element
vector of counterparties. Counterparties can be a vector of numeric IDs or a cell array of
counterparty names. By default, each counterparty is assumed to have one netting set that covers all
of its contracts. If counterparties are covered by multiple netting sets, then use the NettingID
parameter. A value of NaN (or '' in a cell array) indicates that a contract is not included in any
netting set unless otherwise specified by NettingID. counterparties is case insensitive and
leading or trailing white spaces are removed.

Data Types: double | cell

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.
