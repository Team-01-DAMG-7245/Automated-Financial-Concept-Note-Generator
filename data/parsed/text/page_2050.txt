(Optional) Correlation matrix, specified as an n-by-n correlation coefficient matrix. A correlation
coefficient is a statistic in which the covariance is scaled to a value between minus one (perfect
negative correlation) and plus one (perfect positive correlation).

If ExpCorrC is not specified, the processes are assumed to be uncorrelated, and the identity matrix is
used.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

ExpCovariance â€” Covariance matrix
matrix

Covariance matrix, returned as an n-by-n covariance matrix, where n is the number of processes.

The (i,j) entry is the expectation of the i'th fluctuation from the mean times the j'th fluctuation from
the mean.

ExpCov(i,j) = ExpCorrC(i,j)*ExpSigma(i)*ExpSigma(j)
