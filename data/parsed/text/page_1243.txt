Fit a simple univariate Vasicek model to the daily equivalent yields of the three-month Euribor data:

Given initial conditions, the distribution of the short rate at some time T in the future is Gaussian with
mean:

and variance:

To calibrate this simple short-rate model, rewrite it in more familiar regression format:

where:

perform an ordinary linear regression where the model volatility is proportional to the standard error
of the residuals:

yields     = Dataset.EB3M;
regressors = [ones(length(yields) - 1, 1) yields(1:end-1)];
