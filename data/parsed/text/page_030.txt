Introduction

Many financial analysis procedures involve sets of numbers; for example, a portfolio of securities at
various prices and yields. Matrices, matrix functions, and matrix algebra are the most efficient ways
to analyze sets of numbers and their relationships. Spreadsheets focus on individual cells and the
relationships between cells. While you can think of a set of spreadsheet cells (a range of rows and
columns) as a matrix, a matrix-oriented tool like MATLAB® software manipulates sets of numbers
more quickly, easily, and naturally. For more information, see “Matrix Algebra Refresher” on page 1-
7.

Key Definitions

Matrix

A rectangular array of numeric or algebraic quantities subject to mathematical operations; the
regular formation of elements into rows and columns. Described as a “m-by-n” matrix, with m the
number of rows and n the number of columns. The description is always “row-by-column.” For
example, here is a 2-by-3 matrix of two bonds (the rows) with different par values, coupon rates, and
coupon payment frequencies per year (the columns) entered using MATLAB notation:

Bonds = [1000   0.06   2
          500   0.055  4]

Vector

A matrix with only one row or column. Described as a “1-by-n” or “m-by-1” matrix. The description is
always “row-by-column.” For example, here is a 1-by-4 vector of cash flows in MATLAB notation:

Cash = [1500   4470   5280   -1299]

Scalar

A 1-by-1 matrix; that is, a single number.

Referencing Matrix Elements

To reference specific matrix elements, use (row, column) notation. For example:

Bonds(1,2)

ans =

0.06
