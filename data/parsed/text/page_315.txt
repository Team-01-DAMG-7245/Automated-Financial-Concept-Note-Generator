An example of a portfolio optimization problem that has difficulties at the endpoints of the efficient
frontier is this standard mean-variance portfolio problem (long-only with a budget constraint) with
the following mean and covariance of asset returns:

m = [ 1; 2; 3 ];
C = [ 1 1 0; 1 1 0; 0 0 1 ];

p = Portfolio;
p = Portfolio(p, 'assetmean', m, 'assetcovar', C);
p = Portfolio(p, 'lowerbudget', 1, 'upperbudget', 1);
p = Portfolio(p, 'lowerbound', 0);

plotFrontier(p)

To work around this problem, set the hidden Portfolio object property for enforcePareto. This
property instructs the optimizer to perform extra steps to ensure a Pareto-optimal solution. This slows
down the solver, but guarantees a Pareto-optimal solution.

p.enforcePareto = true;
plotFrontier(p)
