where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

lG is the lower-bound group constraint (nG vector).

uG is the upper-bound group constraint (nG vector).

G is the matrix of group membership indexes (nG-by-n matrix).

Each row of G identifies which assets belong to a group associated with that row. Each row contains
either 0s or 1s with 1 indicating that an asset is part of the group or 0 indicating that the asset is not
part of the group.

Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, and PortfolioMAD object properties to specify group constraints
are:

•
GroupMatrix for G

•
LowerGroup for lG
•
UpperGroup for uG
•
NumAssets for n

The default is to ignore these constraints.

Group Ratio Constraints

Group ratio constraints are specialized linear constraints that enforce relationships among groups of
assets. Use setGroupRatio to set group ratio constraints. The constraints take the form

lRi(GBx)i ≤(GAx)i ≤uRi(GBx)i

for i = 1,..., nR where:

x is the portfolio (n vector).

lR is the vector of lower-bound group ratio constraints (nR vector).

uR is the vector matrix of upper-bound group ratio constraints (nR vector).

GA is the matrix of base group membership indexes (nR-by-n matrix).

GB is the matrix of comparison group membership indexes (nR-by-n matrix).

n is the number of assets in the universe and nR is the number of constraints.

Each row of GA and GB identifies which assets belong to a base and comparison group associated with
that row.

Each row contains either 0s or 1s with 1 indicating that an asset is part of the group or 0 indicating
that the asset is not part of the group.

constraints are:
