assumed to give the customer a total of 238 points (this is a fictitious example on an arbitrary scoring
scale).

Technically, to determine the credit scorecard points, start out by selecting a set of potential
predictors (column 1 in the next figure). Then, bin data into groups (for example, ages ‘Up to 25’, ’25
to 40’ (column 2 in the figure). This grouping helps to distinguish between “good” and “bad”
customers. The Weight of Evidence (WOE) is a way to measure how well the distribution of “good”
and “bad” are separated across bins or groups for each individual predictor (column 3 in the figure).
By fitting a logistic regression model, you can identify which predictors, when put together, do a
better job distinguishing between “good” and “bad” customers. The model is summarized by its
coefficients (column 4 in the figure). Finally, the combination of WOE’s and model coefficients
(commonly scaled, shifted, and rounded) make up the scorecard points (column 5 in the figure).

Data gathering and preparation phase

This includes data gathering and integration, such as querying, merging, aligning. It also
includes treatment of missing information and outliers. There is a prescreening step based on
reports of association measures between the predictors and the response variable. Finally, there
