Effective Rate of Return

The effective rate of return (ERR) is a measure of the actual return on an investment, taking into
account the effects of compounding over a specific period.

The ERR provides a more accurate representation of the profitability of an investment compared to
nominal interest rates, which do not consider compounding effects. The effective rate of return is
particularly useful for comparing different investment options with varying compounding periods.
