Portfolio Optimization Using Factor Models

This example shows two approaches for using a factor model to optimize asset allocation under a
mean-variance framework. Multifactor models are often used in risk modeling, portfolio management,
and portfolio performance attribution. A multifactor model reduces the dimension of the investment
universe and is responsible for describing most of the randomness of the market [1 on page 4-236].
The factors can be statistical, macroeconomic, and fundamental. In the first approach in this example,
you build statistical factors from asset returns and optimize the allocation directly against the factors.
In the second approach you use the given factor information to compute the covariance matrix of the
asset returns and then use the Portfolio class to optimize the asset allocation.

Load Data

Load a simulated data set, which includes asset returns total p = 100 assets and 2000 daily
observations.

load('asset_return_100_simulated.mat');
[nObservation, p] = size(stockReturns)

nObservation = 
2000

p = 
100

splitPoint = ceil(nObservation*0.6);
training = 1:splitPoint;
test = splitPoint+1:nObservation;
trainingNum = numel(training);

Visualize the equity curve for each stock. For this example, plot the first five stocks.

plot(ret2tick(stockReturns{training,1:5}, 'method', 'simple')*100); hold off;
xlabel('Timestep');
ylabel('Value');
title('Equity Curve');
legend(stockReturns.Properties.VariableNames(1:5), 'Location',"bestoutside",'Interpreter', 'none
