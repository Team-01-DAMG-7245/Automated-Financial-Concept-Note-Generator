the series of zero-coupon Treasury rates consistent with the prices of the coupon-bearing bonds such
that arbitrage opportunities will not exist.

ZeroRates = zbtprice([Maturity CouponRate], Prices, Settle)

ZeroRates = 10×1

0.0614
    0.0642
    0.0660
    0.0684
    0.0702
    0.0726
    0.0754
    0.0795
    0.0827
    0.0868

The zero curve, stored in ZeroRates, is quoted on a semiannual bond basis (the periodic, six-month,
interest rate is doubled to annualize). The first element of ZeroRates is the annualized rate over the
next six months, the second element is the annualized rate over the next 12 months, and so on.

Calculate Implied Forward Rates

From the implied zero curve, find the corresponding series of implied forward rates using the term
structure function zero2fwd.

ForwardRates = zero2fwd(ZeroRates, Maturity, Settle)

ForwardRates = 10×1

0.0614
    0.0670
    0.0695
    0.0758
    0.0774
    0.0846
    0.0925
    0.1077
    0.1089
    0.1239

The forward curve, stored in ForwardRates, is also quoted on a semiannual bond basis. The first
element of ForwardRates is the annualized rate applied to the interval between settlement and six
months after settlement, the second element is the annualized rate applied to the interval from six
months to 12 months after settlement, and so on. This implied forward curve is also consistent with
the observed market prices such that arbitrage activities will be unprofitable. Since the first forward
rate is also a zero rate, the first element of ZeroRates and ForwardRates are the same.

Convert Zero Curve to Discount Factors

Now that you have derived the zero curve, convert it to a sequence of discount factors with the term
structure function zero2disc.

DiscountFactors = zero2disc(ZeroRates, Maturity, Settle)
