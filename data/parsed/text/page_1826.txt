Last actual coupon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'LastCouponDate'
and a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. LastCouponDate is used when a bond has an
irregular last coupon period. In the absence of a specified FirstCouponDate, a specified
LastCouponDate determines the coupon structure of the bond. The coupon structure of a bond is
truncated at the LastCouponDate, regardless of where it falls, and is followed only by the bond's
maturity cash flow date.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

StartDate — Forward starting date of payments
if you do not specify StartDate, effective start date is Settle date (default) | datetime scalar |
string scalar | date character vector

Forward starting date of payments, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'StartDate' and a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. StartDate is when a bond
actually starts (the date from which a bond cash flow is considered). To make an instrument forward-
starting, specify this date as a future date.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

Data Types: char | datetime | string

BusinessDayConvention — Business day conventions
'actual' (default) | character vector or string object with values'actual', 'follow',
'modifiedfollow', 'previous'or 'modifiedprevious'

Business day conventions, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BusinessDayConvention' and a character vector or a string object. The selection for business
day convention determines how nonbusiness days are treated. Nonbusiness days are defined as
weekends plus any other date that businesses are not open (for example, statutory holidays). Values
are:

•
'actual' — Nonbusiness days are effectively ignored. Cash flows that fall on non-business days
are assumed to be distributed on the actual date.

•
'follow' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed on the
following business day.

•
'modifiedfollow' — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed
on the following business day. However if the following business day is in a different month, the
previous business day is adopted instead.

•
'previous' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed on the
previous business day.

•
'modifiedprevious' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed
on the previous business day. However if the previous business day is in a different month, the
following business day is adopted instead.
