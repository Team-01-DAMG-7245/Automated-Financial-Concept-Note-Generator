In the efficient frontiers in the above figure, the lower-left part of the red efficient frontier line for the
portfolio with a risk-free asset is in range [0,1] and is actually the capital allocation line (CAL). The
slope of this line is the maximum Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, which demonstrates how return is best
awarded by taking extra risk. The upper right of the red efficient frontier line is the same as a fully
invested portfolio (blue line). Once the portfolio crosses the Sharpe ratio point, the portfolio is fully
invested and there is no more cash available to allow high risk-awarded returns following the straight
CAL. However, if borrowing of a risk-free asset is allowed, you can effectively use the funds from the
borrowing of a risk-free asset to invest in more risky assets, as demonstrated in the "Portfolio with
Leverage" section.

Portfolio with Leverage

To fund investments in risky assets, consider using leverage by borrowing a risk-free asset. The
Portfolio class enables you to use leverage in asset allocation when a risk-free asset is available in
the portfolio.

First, check if the RiskFreeRate property for the Portfolio object is nonzero.
