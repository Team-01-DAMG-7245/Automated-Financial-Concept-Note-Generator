daysdif

Days between dates for any day-count basis

Syntax

NumDays = daysdif(StartDate,EndDate)
NumDays = daysdif( ___ ,Basis)

Description

NumDays = daysdif(StartDate,EndDate) returns the number of days between dates
StartDate and EndDate. The first date for StartDate is not included when determining the
number of days between first and last date.

Any input argument can contain multiple values, but if so, the other inputs must contain the same
number of values or a single value that applies to all. For example, if StartDate is an n-row cell
array of character vectors , then EndDate must be an n-row cell array of character vectors or a single
date character vector. NumDays is then an N-by-1 vector of numbers.

NumDays = daysdif( ___ ,Basis) returns the number of days between dates StartDate and
EndDate using the optional argument Basis for day-count. The first date for StartDate is not
included when determining the number of days between first and last date.

Any input argument can contain multiple values, but if so, the other inputs must contain the same
number of values or a single value that applies to all. For example, if StartDate is an n-row datetime
array, then EndDate must be an n-row datetime array or a single datetime. NumDays is then an N-
by-1 vector of numbers.

Examples

Determine the Number of Days Between StartDate and EndDate

Determine the NumDays using date character vectors for StartDate and EndDate.

NumDays = daysdif('3/1/99', '3/1/00', 1)

NumDays = 
360

Determine the NumDays using datetimes for StartDate and EndDate.

NumDays = daysdif(datetime(1999,3,1) ,datetime(2000,3,1), 1)

NumDays = 
360

Determine the NumDays using a datetime array for EndDate.

MoreDays = [datetime(2001,3,1) ; datetime(2002,3,1) ; datetime(2003,3,1)]; 
NumDays = daysdif(datetime(1998,3,1), MoreDays)
