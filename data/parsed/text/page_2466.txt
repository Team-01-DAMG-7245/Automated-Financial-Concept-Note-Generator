dx — Decrement counts for N ages and num series
matrix

Decrement counts for N ages and num series, returned as an N-by-num matrix. The series dx is the
number of people out of 100,000 alive at birth who die between age x and the next age in the series.
For the last age, dx represent probabilities or counts for all ages after the last age.

The last row of the N-by-num output for dx are values for all ages on or after the last age in x (due to
“Forced Termination” on page 15-1160). Therefore, the last row of dx contains the remaining count of
100,000 people alive at birth who have not died by the last age.

More About

Life Table

A life table is a statistical table used in demography and actuarial science to summarize the mortality
experience of a population.

A life table provides a detailed breakdown of the probability of death and survival at various ages,
allowing for the analysis of life expectancy and the assessment of the health status of a population.

Forced Termination

Most modern life tables have “forced” termination. Forced termination means that the last row of the
life table applies for all persons with ages on or after the last age in the life table.

This sample illustrates forced termination.

In this case, the last row of the life table applies for all persons aged 100 or older. Specifically, qx
probabilities are 1qx for ages less than 100 and, technically, ∞qx for age 100.

Forced termination has terminal age values that apply to all ages after the terminal age so that lx is
positive, qx is 1, and dx is positive. Ages after the terminal age are NaN values, although lx and dx
can be 0 and qx can be 1 for input series. Forced termination is triggered by a naturally terminating
series, the last age in a truncated series, or the first NaN value in a series.
