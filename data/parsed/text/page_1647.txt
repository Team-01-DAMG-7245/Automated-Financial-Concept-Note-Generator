Paths is a 3-by-2 matrix of the simulated paths of state variables and the output Z is a matrix of
random variates used to generate the Brownian motion vector.

Input Arguments

MDL — Stochastic differential equation model for RVM or roughbergomi
rvm object | roughbergomi object

Stochastic differential equation model, specified as an rvm object or roughbergomi object.

Data Types: object

NPeriods — Number of simulation periods
positive scalar integer

Number of simulation periods, specified as a positive scalar integer. The value of NPeriods
determines the number of rows of the simulated output series.

Data Types: double

Name-Value Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Example: [Paths,Times,Z] = simByHybrid(rvm,NPeriods,DeltaTime=dt)

NTrials — Simulated trials (sample paths) of NPeriods observations each
1 (single path of correlated state variables) (default) | positive scalar integer

Simulated trials (sample paths) of NPeriods observations each, specified as a positive scalar integer.

Data Types: double

DeltaTime — Positive time increments between observations
1 (default) | positive scalar numeric

Positive time increments between observations, specified as a positive scalar numeric.

DeltaTime represents the dt found in stochastic differential equations and determines the times at
which the simulated paths of the output state variables are reported.

Data Types: double

NSteps — Number of intermediate time steps within each time increment dt (specified as
DeltaTime)
1 (indicating no intermediate evaluation) (default) | positive scalar integer

Number of intermediate time steps within each time increment dt (specified as DeltaTime),
specified as a positive scalar integer.
