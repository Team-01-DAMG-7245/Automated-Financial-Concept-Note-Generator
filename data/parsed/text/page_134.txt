In general, each curve represents the ability of the model to distinguish observations that are in the
corresponding class from the other two classes at various classification decision thresholds. For
example, the blue curve corresponds to the ability of the classifiers to correctly distinguish losses
from constants or gains. The diagonal dashed line is a hypothetical classifier that assigns
observations into classes at random, which is a baseline for comparison. The curve of a good
classifier increases very quickly and then levels off, making the area under the curve (AUC) close to
1. In other words, a good classifier has a high true positive rate for all classification decision
thresholds, regardless of false positive rate levels produced. Note that the ROC curve does not
consider false negative rates.

In this case, the risky LSTM is better at correctly distinguishing each class from the other two than
the conservative LSTM; the AUCs of the risky LSTM are larger than the corresponding AUCs of the
conservative LSTM.

Backtest Risky LSTM Model

Backtesting a predictive financial model dispatches it, and a trading strategy based on its predictions,
on historical data. This action determines how well the model performs, with respect to the strategy.
A backtest requires:

•
Historical data not used to train or validate the model (see Partition Data on page 2-83)

•
The target predictive model (The risky LSTM neural network RiskyLSTMMdl)

•
The model's predictions (signals) on the historical data

•
At least one trading strategy

Classify the forward price movements in the backtest data XBT using the risky LSTM neural network.

[predScoresRLSTMBT] = minibatchpredict(RiskyLSTMMdl,XBT,InputDataFormats="CTB");
predYRLSTMBT = scores2label(predScoresRLSTMBT,classes);
