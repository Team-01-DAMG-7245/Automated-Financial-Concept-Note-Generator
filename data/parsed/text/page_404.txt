This example demonstrates how to derive statistical factors from asset returns using PCA and then
use these factors to perform a factor-based portfolio optimization. This example also shows how to
use these statistical factors with the Portfolio class. In practice, you can adapt this example to
incorporate some measurable market factors, such as industrial factors or ETF returns from various
sectors, to describe the randomness in the market [1 on page 4-236]. You can define custom
constraints on the weights of factors or assets with high flexibility using the problem-based definition
framework from Optimization Toolbox™. Alternatively, you can work directly with the Portfolio
class to run a portfolio optimization with various built-in constraints.
