Compute Risk Contribution for Each Asset

Use portfolioRiskContribution to check that the risk contribution of the portfolio obtained in
wRB matches the target risk budget. By default, portfolioRiskContribution computes the
relative risk contribution of a given portfolio (wRB) with respect to the provided covariance matrix
(Sigma).

prc = portfolioRiskContribution(wRB,Sigma)

prc = 3×1

0.5000
    0.2500

As expected, the risk contribution of each asset matches the target risk budget (budget). You can
also use portfolioRiskContribution to compute the absolute risk contribution of each asset.

mrc = portfolioRiskContribution(wRB,Sigma,RiskContributionType="absolute")

mrc = 3×1

Compare Risk Budgeting Portfolios with Mean-Variance

While the allocation strategy of the risk budgeting portfolio focuses only on the risk, the allocation
strategy of the mean-variance portfolio also makes use of the assets' return information.

% Define the returns mean.
mu = [0.08; 0.08; 0.05];

Initialize a Portfolio object with default constraints using Sigma and mu.

% Define the mean-variance portfolio.
p = Portfolio(AssetMean=mu,AssetCovar=Sigma);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

Compute the portfolio on the efficient frontier with a target volatility equal to the risk attained by the
risk budgeting portfolio previously computed as wRB.

% Define the target volatility.
targetRisk = sqrt(wRB'*Sigma*wRB);
wMV = estimateFrontierByRisk(p,targetRisk)

wMV = 3×1
