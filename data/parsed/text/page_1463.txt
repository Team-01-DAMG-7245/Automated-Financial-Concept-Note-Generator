sde

Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) model

Description

Creates and displays a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) model from user-defined drift
and diffusion rate functions.

Use sde objects to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables driven by NBROWNS Brownian
motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-
time stochastic processes.

An sde object enables you to simulate any vector-valued SDE of the form:

dXt = F(t, Xt)dt + G(t, Xt)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
dWt is an NBROWNS-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
F is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued drift-rate function.

•
G is an NVars-by-NBROWNS matrix-valued diffusion-rate function.

Creation

Syntax

SDE = sde(DriftRate,DiffusionRate)
SDE = sde( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

SDE = sde(DriftRate,DiffusionRate) creates a default SDE object.

SDE = sde( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a SDE object with additional options specified by one or
more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN.

The SDE object has the following “Properties” on page 15-158:

•
StartTime — Initial observation time

•
StartState — Initial state at time StartTime

•
Correlation — Access function for the Correlation input argument, callable as a function of
time
