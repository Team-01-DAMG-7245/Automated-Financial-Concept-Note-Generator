Covariance — Estimates for covariance matrix of residuals of the regression
matrix

Estimates for the covariance matrix of the residuals of the regression, specified as an NUMSERIES-by-
NUMSERIES matrix.

Data Types: double

CovarFormat — Format for covariance matrix
'full' (default) | character vector with value 'full' or 'diagonal'

(Optional) Format for the covariance matrix, specified as a character vector. The choices are:

•
'full' — This is the default method that computes the full covariance matrix.

•
'diagonal' — This forces the covariance matrix to be a diagonal matrix.

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

Objective — Least-squares objective function
scalar

Least-squares objective function, returned as scalar.

More About

Multivariate Normal Regression

Multivariate normal regression is a statistical modeling approach that extends traditional regression
techniques to situations where the dependent variable is multivariate, meaning it consists of multiple
correlated outcomes.

Multivariate normal regression is particularly useful in fields where researchers are interested in
understanding the relationships between several response variables and one or more predictor
variables.
