The fee is charged on each date specified by the ManagementFeeSchedule name-value argument.
For more information, see “Defining Schedules for Backtest Strategies” on page 15-258.

The management fee is forward looking, meaning that a fee paid on a given date covers the
management of the strategy from that date to the next management fee date. For some syntaxes of
theManagementFeeSchedule, the resulting schedule does not begin and end precisely on the
backtest start and end dates. In these cases, the backtest engine adds default dates to the start and
end of the schedule to ensure that the entire backtest is covered by management fees. For example:

•
If ManagementFeeSchedule is specified as a vector of datetimes, and the backtest start date is
not included in the vector, then the start date is added to the fee schedule.

•
If ManagementFeeSchedule is specified as a numeric scalar or a vector of datetimes, and the
final specified fee date occurs before the backtest end date, then the backtest end date is added to
the fee schedule.

•
If ManagementFeeSchedule is specified as a duration or calendarDuration object, and the
backtest end date is not included in the generated schedule, then a final fee date is added to the
end by adding the duration object to the (previous) final fee date. This adjustment can produce a
final fee date that is beyond the end of the backtest, but it results in more realistic fees paid at the
final payment date.
