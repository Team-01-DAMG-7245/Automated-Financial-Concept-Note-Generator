Data Types: object

GroupA — Base groups for comparison
matrix of logical or numerical arrays

Base groups for comparison, specified as a matrix of logical or numerical arrays.

Note The group matrices GroupA and GroupB are usually indicators of membership in groups,
which means that their elements are usually either 0 or 1. Because of this interpretation, the GroupA
and GroupB matrices can be logical or numerical arrays.

Data Types: double

GroupB — Comparison group
matrix of logical or numerical arrays

Comparison group, specified as a matrix of logical or numerical arrays.

Note The group matrices GroupA and GroupB are usually indicators of membership in groups,
which means that their elements are usually either 0 or 1. Because of this interpretation, the GroupA
and GroupB matrices can be logical or numerical arrays.

Data Types: double

LowerRatio — Lower-bound for ratio of GroupB groups to GroupA groups
vector

Lower-bound for ratio of GroupB groups to GroupA groups, specified as a vector.

Note If input is scalar, LowerRatio undergoes scalar expansion to be conformable with the group
matrices.

Data Types: double

UpperRatio — Upper-bound for ratio of GroupB groups to GroupA groups
vector

Upper-bound for ratio of GroupB groups to GroupA groups, specified as a vector.

Note If input is scalar, UpperRatio undergoes scalar expansion to be conformable with the group
matrices.
