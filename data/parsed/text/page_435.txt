To visualize the tradeoff between a portfolio's average percentage of WoB and the traditional mean-
variance efficient frontier, a set of contour plots are computed for some target WoB percentages using
the plotContours function in Local Functions on page 4-269.

nC = 5; % Number of contour plots
minContour = max(pWoB{1}); % WoB values lower than this return
                           % overlapped contours.

% Plot the contours.
plotContours(p,minContour,maxWoB,nC,N)

Exclusion Examples

Instead of requiring a specific level for the portfolio's average percentage of WoB, the goal is to find
the traditional mean-variance efficient frontiers while excluding assets that have a percentage of WoB
lower than a given threshold. You can plot the exclusion using the plotExclusionExample function
in Local Functions on page 4-269.

% Remove the average percetage of WoB constraint.
p.AInequality = []; p.bInequality = [];

% Set of thresholds for excluding assets.
thresholdWoB = 0.25:0.05:0.40;

% Plot the exclusion example.
plotExclusionExample(p,WoB,thresholdWoB,N)
