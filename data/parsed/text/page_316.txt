Troubleshooting estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio

When using estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio, nonconvex functions are not supported for
problems with cardinality constraints or conditional bounds. Specifically, the following error displays
when using estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio with a Portfolio object that includes
'Conditional' BoundType (semicontinuous) constraints using setBounds or MinNumAssets and
MaxNumAssets (cardinality) constraints using setMinMaxNumAssets.

Error using solveMICustomObjProb
Objective function must be convex in problems with cardinality constraints and/or conditional bounds.

Error in Portfolio/estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio (line 88)
    [pwgt,exitflag] = solveMICustomObjProb(obj,prob,fun,flags);

Note This error applies only to quadratic functions. This error is not detected in nonlinear functions.
Therefore, if you are using a nonlinear function, you must validate your input.

For more information, see “Role of Convexity in Portfolio Problems” on page 4-157.

Troubleshooting for Setting 'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets,
and MaxNumAssets Constraints

When configuring a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to include
'Conditional' BoundType (semicontinuous) constraints using setBounds or MinNumAssets and
MaxNumAssets (cardinality) constraints using setMinMaxNumAssets, the values of the inputs that
you supply can result in warning messages.
