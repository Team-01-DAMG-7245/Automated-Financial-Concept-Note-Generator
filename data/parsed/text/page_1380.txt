If you specify it as a function of time and state, Alpha must return an NVars-by-1 column vector of
exponents when invoked with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function_handle

Sigma — Sigma represents the parameter V
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Sigma represents the parameter V, specified as an array or a deterministic function of time.

If you specify Sigma as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix of instantaneous volatility
rates. In this case, each row of Sigma corresponds to a particular state variable. Each column
corresponds to a particular Brownian source of uncertainty, and associates the magnitude of the
exposure of state variables with sources of uncertainty.

As a deterministic function of time, when Sigma is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Sigma must produce an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix. If you specify Sigma as a function of time
and state, it must return an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix of volatility rates when invoked with two
inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Note Although cev does not enforce restrictions on the signs of these input arguments, each
argument is specified as a positive value.

Output Arguments

CEV — CEV model
CEV object

CEV model, returned as a CEV object.

Properties

StartTime — Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables
0 (default) | scalar

Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables, specified as a scalar

Data Types: double

StartState — Initial values of state variables
1 (default) | scalar, column vector, or matrix

Initial values of state variables, specified as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

If StartState is a scalar, cev applies the same initial value to all state variables on all trials.
