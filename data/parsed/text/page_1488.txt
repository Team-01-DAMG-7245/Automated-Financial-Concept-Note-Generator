sdemrd

SDE with Mean-Reverting Drift (SDEMRD) model

Description

Creates and displays a SDE object whose drift rate is expressed in mean-reverting drift-rate form and
which derives from the sdeddo class (SDE from drift and diffusion objects).

Use sdemrd objects to simulate of sample paths of NVars state variables expressed in mean-
reverting drift-rate form, and provide a parametric alternative to the linear drift form (see sdeld).
These state variables are driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods
consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time stochastic processes with mean-
reverting drift-rate functions.

The sdemrd object allows you to simulate any vector-valued SDEMRD of the form:

dXt = S(t)[L(t) −Xt]dt + D(t, Xt
α(t))V(t)dWt

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean reversion speeds.

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels.

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
corresponding element of the state vector raised to the corresponding power of α.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

Creation

Syntax

SDEMRD = sdemrd(Speed,Level,Alpha,Sigma)
SDEMRD = sdemrd( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

SDEMRD = sdemrd(Speed,Level,Alpha,Sigma) creates a default SDEMRD object.

SDEMRD = sdemrd( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a SDEMRD object with additional options specified
by one or more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN.

The SDELD object has the following displayed “Properties” on page 15-184:
