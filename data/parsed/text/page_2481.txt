18    18   NaN

The first two series experience their maximum drawdowns from the second to the 18th month in the
data. The indices for the third series are NaNs because it never has a drawdown.

The 16.58% value loss from month 2 to month 18 for the fund series is verified using the reported
indices.

Start = MaxDDIndex(1,:);
End = MaxDDIndex(2,:);
(TestData(Start(1),1) - TestData(End(1),1))/TestData(Start(1),1)

ans = 
0.1658

ans = 0.1658

Although the maximum drawdown is measured in terms of returns, maxdrawdown can measure the
drawdown in terms of absolute drop in value, or in terms of log-returns. To contrast these alternatives
more clearly, you can work with the fund series, assuming an initial investment of 50 dollars:

Fund50 = 50*TestData(:,1);
plot(Fund50);
title('\bfFive-Year Fund Performance, Initial Investment 50 usd');
xlabel('Months');
ylabel('Value of Investment');

First, compute the standard maximum drawdown, which coincides with the results above because
returns are independent of the initial amounts invested.

MaxDD50Ret = maxdrawdown(Fund50)
