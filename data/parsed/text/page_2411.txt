getInequality

Obtain inequality constraint arrays from portfolio object

Syntax

[AInequality,bInequality] = getInequality(obj)

Description

Use the getInequality function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain inequality constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[AInequality,bInequality] = getInequality(obj) obtains equality constraint arrays from
portfolio objects.

Examples

Obtain Inequality Constraints for a Portfolio Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets are no
more than 50% of your portfolio. Given a Portfolio object p, set the linear inequality constraints and
then obtain values for AInequality and bInequality.

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = Portfolio;
p = setInequality(p, A, b);
[AInequality, bInequality] = getInequality(p)

AInequality = 1×5

1     1     1     0     0

bInequality = 
0.5000

Obtain Inequality Constraints for a PortfolioCVaR Object

Suppose you have a portfolio of five assets and you want to ensure that the first three assets
constitute at most 50% of your portfolio. Given a PortfolioCVaR object p, set the linear inequality
constraints and then obtain values for AInequality and bInequality.

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
