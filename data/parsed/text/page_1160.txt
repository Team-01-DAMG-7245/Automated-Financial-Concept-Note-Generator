Filter Returns for Equity Index

To accurately model the tails of a distribution using a GPD, you must make sure the observations are
approximately independent and identically distributed. However, financial return series often deviate
from this requirement due to autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. To see an example of this
deviation, use autocorr (Econometrics Toolbox) to analyze the sample autocorrelation function
(ACF) of the returns associated with the TSX Composite index. The result indicates the presence of
mild serial correlation.

returns = price2ret(Data);    % Logarithmic returns
T       = size(returns,1);    % Number of returns (the historical sample size)

index = 1;
