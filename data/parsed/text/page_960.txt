In general, one expects that higher credit indices correspond to riskier years. The series of credit
indices found does not entirely match this pattern. There may be different reasons for this. First,
transition probabilities may deviate from their long-term averages in different ways that may lead to
confounding effects in the single parameter trying to capture these differences, the credit index.
Having separate credit indices for IG and SG, for example, may help separate confounding effects.
Second, a difference of five basis points may be very significant for the 'BBB' default rate, but not as
important for the 'CCC' default rate, yet the norm used weights them equally. Other norms can be
considered. Also, it is always a good idea to check the exit flags of optimization solvers, in case the
algorithm could not find a solution. Here you get valid solutions for each year (all exit flags are 1).

The workflow above can be adapted to work with the series of credit indices instead of the series of
corporate default rates. A model can be fit to predict a credit index for the following year, and a
predicted transition matrix can be inferred and used for risk analyses.
