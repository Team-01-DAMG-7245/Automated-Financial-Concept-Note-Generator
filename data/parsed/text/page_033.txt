Introduction

The explanations in the sections that follow should help refresh your skills for using matrix algebra
and using MATLAB functions.

In addition, Macro-Investment Analysis by William Sharpe also provides an excellent explanation of
matrix algebra operations using MATLAB. It is available on the web at:

Tip When you are setting up a problem, it helps to "talk through" the units and dimensions
associated with each input and output matrix. In the example under “Multiplying Matrices” on page
1-8, one input matrix has five days' closing prices for three stocks, the other input matrix has
shares of three stocks in two portfolios, and the output matrix therefore has five days' closing values
for two portfolios. It also helps to name variables using descriptive terms.

Adding and Subtracting Matrices

Matrix addition and subtraction operate element-by-element. The two input matrices must have the
same dimensions. The result is a new matrix of the same dimensions where each element is the sum
or difference of each corresponding input element. For example, consider combining portfolios of
different quantities of the same stocks (“shares of stocks A, B, and C [the rows] in portfolios P and Q
[the columns] plus shares of A, B, and C in portfolios R and S”).

Portfolios_PQ = [100   200
                 500   400
                 300   150];

Portfolios_RS = [175   125
                 200   200
                 100   500];

NewPortfolios = Portfolios_PQ + Portfolios_RS

NewPortfolios =

275           325
        700           600
        400           650
