For more information, see “Basis” on page 2-16.

Note If a SIA day-count basis is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value assigned
for DiscountBasis, the default behavior is for SIA bases to use the actual/actual day count to
compute discount factors.

If an ICMA day-count basis or BUS/252 is defined in the Basis input argument and there is no value
assigned for DiscountBasis, the specified bases from the Basis input argument are used.

Data Types: double

Holidays — Dates for holidays
holidays.m used (default) | datetime array | string array | date character vector

Dates for holidays, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Holidays' and a
NHOLIDAYS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors. Holidays are
used in computing business days. For an example, see “Use cfamounts with User-Defined Holiday
Calendar” on page 15-671.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

PrincipalType — Type of principal when a Face schedule is specified
sinking (default) | character vector with values 'sinking' or 'bullet'

Type of principal when a Face schedule, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'PrincipalType' and a value of 'sinking' or 'bullet' using a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector.

If 'sinking', principal cash flows are returned throughout the life of the bond.

If 'bullet', principal cash flow is only returned at maturity.

Data Types: char | cell
