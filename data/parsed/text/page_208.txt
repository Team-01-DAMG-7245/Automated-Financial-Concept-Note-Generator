Setting Up a Tracking Portfolio

Given a benchmark or tracking portfolio, you can ensure that the risk of a portfolio relative to the
benchmark portfolio is no greater than a specified amount. The Portfolio object property
TrackingPort lets you identify a tracking portfolio. For more information on using a tracking
portfolio with tracking error constraints, see “Working with Tracking Error Constraints Using
Portfolio Object” on page 4-91.

The tracking error constraints can be used with any of the other supported constraints in the
Portfolio object without restrictions. However, since the portfolio set necessarily and sufficiently
must be a non-empty compact set, the application of a tracking error constraint can result in an
empty portfolio set. Use estimateBounds to confirm that the portfolio set is non-empty and
compact.

Suppose that you have an initial portfolio in x0, then use the Portfolio object to set up a tracking
portfolio:

x0 = [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ];
p = Portfolio('TrackingPort', x0);
disp(p.TrackingPort)

0.3000
    0.2000
    0.2000
         0

As with all array properties, you can set TrackingPort with scalar expansion. This is helpful to set
up an equally weighted tracking portfolio of, for example, 10 assets:

p = Portfolio('NumAssets', 10, 'TrackingPort', 1/10);
disp(p.TrackingPort)

0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000
    0.1000

To clear a tracking portfolio from your Portfolio object, use either the Portfolio object or the
setTrackingPort function with an empty input for the TrackingPort property. If transaction
costs or turnover constraints are set, it is not possible to clear the TrackingPort property in this
way. In this case, to clear TrackingPort, first clear the dependent properties and then clear
theTrackingPort property.

The TrackingPort property can also be set with setTrackingPort which lets you specify the
number of assets if you want to use scalar expansion. For example, given an initial portfolio in x0, use
setTrackingPort to set the TrackingPort property:

p = Portfolio;
x0 = [ 0.3; 0.2; 0.2; 0.0 ];
p = setTrackingPort(p, x0);
disp(p.TrackingPort)
