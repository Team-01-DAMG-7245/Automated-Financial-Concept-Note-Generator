rebaseDate = datetime(2022, 01, 01);
inflation{:, 1} = inflation{:, 1} / inflation{rebaseDate, 1};

Determine the common dates between the commodity series and the inflation metric.

[inflationIdx, commodityIdx] = intersect(inflation.DATE, Prices.Date);

Adjust the commodity prices over this time range using the inflation metric.

Prices = Prices(commodityIdx, :);
inflation = inflation{inflationIdx, :};
Prices.Variables = Prices.Variables .* inflation;

Visualize Adjusted Commodity Price Data

Plot each price series for soft commodities over time.

commodityNames = string(Prices.Properties.VariableNames);
