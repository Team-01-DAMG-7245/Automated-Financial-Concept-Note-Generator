'5/17/99'
'5/17'

Also, both of these formats represent the same time.

'17-May-1999, 18:30'
'5/17/99/6:30 pm'

The default format for numbers-only input follows the US convention. Therefore, 3/6 is March 6, not
June 3.

With datenum, you can convert dates into serial date format, store them in a matrix variable, and
then later pass the variable to a function. Alternatively, you can use datenum directly in a function
input argument list.

For example, consider the function bndprice that computes the price of a bond given the yield to
maturity. First set up variables for the yield to maturity, coupon rate, and the necessary dates.

Yield       = 0.07;
CouponRate  = 0.08;
Settle      = datenum('17-May-2000');
Maturity    = datenum('01-Oct-2000');

Then call the function with the variables.

bndprice(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)

ans =

100.3503

Alternatively, convert date character vectors to serial date numbers directly in the function input
argument list.

bndprice(0.07,0.08,datenum('17-May-2000'),... 
datenum('01-Oct-2000'))

ans =

100.3503

bndprice is an example of a function designed to detect the presence of date character vectors and
make the conversion automatically. For functions like bndprice, date character vectors can be
passed directly.

bndprice(0.07,0.08,'17-May-2000','01-Oct-2000')

ans =

100.3503

The decision to represent dates as either date character vectors or serial date numbers is often a
matter of convenience. For example, when formatting data for visual display or for debugging date-
handling code, you can view dates more easily as date character vectors because serial date numbers
are difficult to interpret. Alternately, serial date numbers are just another type of numeric data, which
you can place in a matrix along with any other numeric data for convenient manipulation.

Remember that if you create a vector of input date character vectors, use a column vector, and be
sure that all character vectors are the same length. To ensure that the character vectors are the same
