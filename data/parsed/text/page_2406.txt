More About

Group Constraints

Group constraints specify that the total weight or allocation of assets within a particular group must
satisfy certain conditions relative to the total portfolio.

Group constraints help maintain diversification by preventing excessive concentration in specific
asset groups. They also align the portfolio with the investor's risk tolerance and investment strategy.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to obtain the group constraint arrays from portfolio objects.

[GroupMatrix, LowerGroup, UpperGroup] = obj.getGroups;
