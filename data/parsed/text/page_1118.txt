Compute Present Value of Cash Flows

From the discount factors, compute the present value of the variable cash flows derived from the
implied forward rates. For plain interest rate swaps, the notional principal remains constant for each
payment date and cancels out of each side of the present value equation. The next line assumes unit
notional principal.

PresentValue = sum((ForwardRates/Period) .* DiscountFactors)

PresentValue = 
0.3460

Compute Swap Price

Compute the swap's price (the fixed rate) by equating the present value of the fixed cash flows with
the present value of the cash flows derived from the implied forward rates. Again, since the notional
principal cancels out of each side of the equation, it is assumed to be 1.

SwapFixedRate = Period * PresentValue / sum(DiscountFactors)

SwapFixedRate = 
0.0845
