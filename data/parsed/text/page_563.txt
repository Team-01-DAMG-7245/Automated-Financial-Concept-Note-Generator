Optimize Asset Allocation Using Covariance Denoising

Covariance denoising is a technique that you can use to reduce the noise and enhance the signal in a
covariance matrix. First, the eigenvalues that are associated with noise are separated from the
eigenvalues associated with signal. Then, the eigenvalues associated with noise are shrunk towards a
target value. This technique helps improve the stability of the covariance matrix over time as well as
its condition number.

The function covarianceDenoising computes the denoised estimate of the covariance matrix and
returns as a second output the number of eigenvalues identified with signal. You use this number in
the Optimize the Asset Allocation Using Factor Modeling on page 4-396 section to determine the
number of factors that the factor model allocation uses.

This example uses the first 42 days (approximately 2 months) of the data set to select the initial
portfolio allocations.

% Warm-up period
warmupPeriod = 42;

% No current weights (100% cash position)
w0 = zeros(1,numAssets);

% Warm-up partition of prices timetable
warmupTT = pricesTT(1:warmupPeriod,:);

Compute the maximum return portfolio subject to a target risk of 0.008 using the denoised
covariance estimate.

% Compute the weights with denoised strategy.
wDenoised_initial = denoising(w0,warmupTT);

Check for asset allocations that are over 5% to identify assets with large investment weights.
