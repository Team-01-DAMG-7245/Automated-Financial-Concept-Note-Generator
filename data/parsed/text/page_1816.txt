Vega

A vega sensitivity measures the sensitivity of an option's price to changes in the volatility of the
underlying asset.

Vega represents the amount by which the price of an option would be expected to change for a 1%
change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset. Vega is expressed as the amount of money per
underlying share that the option's value will gain or lose as volatility rises or falls. For example, if an
option has a vega of 0.10, it means that the option's price is expected to change by $0.10 for every
1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying asset.
