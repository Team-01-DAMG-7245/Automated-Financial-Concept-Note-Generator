JumpFreq — Instantaneous jump frequencies representing intensities of Poisson processes
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous jump frequencies representing the intensities (the mean number of jumps per unit
time) of Poisson processes (Nt) that drive the jump simulation, specified as an array, a deterministic
function of time, or a deterministic function of time and state.

If you specify JumpFreq as an array, it must be a scalar.

If you specify JumpFreq as a deterministic function of time, you call JumpFreq with a real-valued
scalar time t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify JumpFreq as a function of time and state, JumpFreq must return a scalar when you
call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
A 2-by-1 bivariate state vector Xt

JumpMean — Instantaneous mean of random percentage jump sizes
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous mean of random percentage jump sizes J, where log(1+J) is normally distributed with
mean (log(1+JumpMean) - 0.5 × JumpVol2) and standard deviation JumpVol, specified as an array, a
deterministic function of time, or a deterministic function of time and state.

If you specify JumpMean as an array, it must be a scalar.

If you specify JumpMean as a deterministic function of time, you call JumpMean with a real-valued
scalar time t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify JumpMean as a function of time and state, JumpMean must return a scalar when you
call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
A 2-by-1 bivariate state vector Xt

Data Types: double | function_handle

JumpVol — Instantaneous standard deviation
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous standard deviation of log(1+J), specified as an array, a deterministic function of time,
or a deterministic function of time and state.

If you specify JumpVol as an array, it must be a scalar.
