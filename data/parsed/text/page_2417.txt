Output Arguments

BuyTurnover — Turnover constraint on purchases
scalar

Turnover constraint on purchases, returned as a scalar for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

scalar

Turnover constraint on sales, returned as a scalar for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

More About

One-way Turnover Constraint

One-way turnover constraint is a specific measure of trading activity in a portfolio that captures the
extent to which assets are bought or sold, but only considers the purchases or sales in one direction
(either buys or sells).

One-way turnover constraints ensure that estimated optimal portfolios differ from an initial portfolio
by no more than specified amounts according to whether the differences are purchases or sales.

The constraints take the form

1Tmax 0, x −x0
≤τB

1Tmax 0, x0 −x
≤τS

with

•
x — The portfolio (NumAssets vector)

•
x0 — Initial portfolio (NumAssets vector)

•
τB — Upper-bound for turnover constraint on purchases (scalar)

•
τS — Upper-bound for turnover constraint on sales (scalar)

Specify one-way turnover constraints using the following properties in a supported portfolio object:
BuyTurnover for τB, SellTurnover for τS, and InitPort for x0.

Note The average turnover constraint (which is set using setTurnover) is not just the combination
of the one-way turnover constraints with the same value for the constraint.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to get the one-way turnover constraint for portfolio objects.

[BuyTurnover,SellTurnover] = obj.getOneWayTurnover
