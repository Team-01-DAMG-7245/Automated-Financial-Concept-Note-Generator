irr

Internal rate of return

Syntax

Return = irr(CashFlow)
[Return,AllRates] = irr( ___ )

Description

Return = irr(CashFlow) calculates the internal rate of return for a series of periodic cash flows.

irr uses the following conventions:

•
If one or more internal rates of returns (warning if multiple) are strictly positive rates, Return
sets to the minimum.

•
If there is no strictly positive rate of returns, but one or multiple (warning if multiple) returns are
nonpositive rates, Return sets to the maximum.

•
If no real-valued rates exist, Return sets to NaN (no warnings).

[Return,AllRates] = irr( ___ ) calculates the internal rate of return and a vector of all internal
rates for a series of periodic cash flows.

Examples

Find a Single and Multiple Internal Rates of Return

Find the internal rate of return for a simple investment with a unique positive rate of return. The
initial investment is $100,000 and the following cash flows represent the yearly income from the
investment

Year 1 $10,000

Year 2 $20,000

Year 3 $30,000

Year 4 $40,000

Year 5 $50,000

Calculate the internal rate of return on the investment:

Return = irr([-100000 10000 20000 30000 40000 50000])

Return = 
0.1201

If the cash flow payments were monthly, then the resulting rate of return is multiplied by 12 for the
annual rate of return.
