abs2active

Convert constraints from absolute to active format

Syntax

ActiveConSet = abs2active(AbsConSet,Index)

Description

ActiveConSet = abs2active(AbsConSet,Index) transforms a constraint matrix to an
equivalent matrix expressed in active weight format (relative to the index).

Examples

Convert Constraints in Terms of Absolute Weights Into Constraints in Terms of Active
Portfolio Weights

Set up constraints for a portfolio optimization for portfolio w0 with constraints in the form A*w <= b,
where w is absolute portfolio weights. (Absolute weights do not depend on the tracking portfolio.) Use
abs2active to convert constraints in terms of absolute weights into constraints in terms of active
portfolio weights, defined relative to the tracking portfolio w0. Assume three assets with the following
mean and covariance of asset returns:

m = [ 0.14; 0.10; 0.05 ];
C = [ 0.29^2 0.4*0.29*0.17 0.1*0.29*0.08; 0.4*0.29*0.17 0.17^2 0.3*0.17*0.08;...
0.1*0.29*0.08 0.3*0.17*0.08 0.08^2 ];

Absolute portfolio constraints are the typical ones (weights sum to 1 and fall from 0 through 1),
create the A and b matrices using portcons.

AbsCons = portcons('PortValue',1,3,'AssetLims', [0; 0; 0], [1; 1; 1;]);

Use the Portfolio object to determine the efficient frontier.

p = Portfolio('AssetMean', m, 'AssetCovar', C);
p = p.setInequality(AbsCons(:,1:end-1), AbsCons(:,end));
p.plotFrontier;
