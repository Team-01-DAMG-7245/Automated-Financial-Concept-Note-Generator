Working with Linear Equality Constraints Using PortfolioMAD
Object

Linear equality constraints are optional linear constraints that impose systems of equalities on
portfolio weights (see “Linear Equality Constraints” on page 6-9). Linear equality constraints have
properties AEquality, for the equality constraint matrix, and bEquality, for the equality constraint
vector.

Setting Linear Equality Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD Function

The properties for linear equality constraints are set using the PortfolioMAD object. Suppose that
you have a portfolio of five assets and want to ensure that the first three assets are 50% of your
portfolio. To set this constraint:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD('AEquality', A, 'bEquality', b);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.AEquality)
disp(p.bEquality)

Setting Linear Equality Constraints Using the setEquality and
addEquality Functions

You can also set the properties for linear equality constraints using setEquality. Suppose that you
have a portfolio of five assets and want to ensure that the first three assets are 50% of your portfolio.
Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use setEquality to set the linear equality constraints:

A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];
b = 0.5;
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setEquality(p, A, b);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.AEquality)
disp(p.bEquality)

Suppose that you want to add another linear equality constraint to ensure that the last three assets
also constitute 50% of your portfolio. You can set up an augmented system of linear equalities or use
addEquality to build up linear equality constraints. For this example, create another system of
equalities:

p = PortfolioMAD;
A = [ 1 1 1 0 0 ];    % first equality constraint
