2)V(t)dWt

where

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
S is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean reversion speeds (the rate of mean reversion).

•
L is an NVars-by-1 vector of mean reversion levels (long-run mean or level).

•
D is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix, where each element along the main diagonal is the
square root of the corresponding element of the state vector.

•
V is an NVars-by-NBrowns instantaneous volatility rate matrix.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.
