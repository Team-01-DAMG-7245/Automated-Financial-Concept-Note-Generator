Number of intermediate time steps within each time increment dt (specified as DeltaTime),
specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'NSteps' and a positive scalar integer.

The simByQuadExp function partitions each time increment dt into NSteps subintervals of length dt/
NSteps, and refines the simulation by evaluating the simulated state vector at NSteps − 1
intermediate points. Although simByQuadExp does not report the output state vector at these
intermediate points, the refinement improves accuracy by allowing the simulation to more closely
approximate the underlying continuous-time process.

Data Types: double

MonteCarloMethod — Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes
"standard" (default) | string with values "standard", "quasi", or "randomized-quasi" |
character vector with values 'standard', 'quasi', or 'randomized-quasi'

Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'MonteCarloMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following
values:

•
"standard" — Monte Carlo using pseudo random numbers.

•
"quasi" — Quasi-Monte Carlo using low-discrepancy sequences.

•
"randomized-quasi" — Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo.

Note If you specify an input noise process (see Z and N), simByQuadExp ignores the value of
MonteCarloMethod.

Data Types: string | char

QuasiSequence — Low discrepancy sequence to drive stochastic processes
"sobol" (default) | string with value "sobol" | character vector with value 'sobol'

Low discrepancy sequence to drive the stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'QuasiSequence' and a string or character vector with one of the following values:

•
"sobol" — Quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences that use a base of two to form successively
finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension

Note If MonteCarloMethod option is not specified or specified as"standard", QuasiSequence is
ignored.

Data Types: string | char

BrownianMotionMethod — Brownian motion construction method
"standard" (default) | string with value "brownian-bridge" or "principal-components" |
character vector with value 'brownian-bridge' or 'principal-components'

Brownian motion construction method, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'BrownianMotionMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following values:

•
"standard" — The Brownian motion path is found by taking the cumulative sum of the Gaussian
variates.
