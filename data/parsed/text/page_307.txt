Another useful tool for covariance estimation is nearcorr. Use nearcorr to compute the nearest
correlation matrix by minimizing the Frobenius distance to an initial estimate. This is particularly
useful to get a positive definite covariance matrix when the number of observations is less than the
number of assets.
