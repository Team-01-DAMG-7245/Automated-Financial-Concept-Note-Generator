Setting Group Ratio Constraints Using the setGroupRatio and
addGroupRatio Functions

You can also set the properties for group ratio constraints using setGroupRatio. For example,
assume that you want the ratio of financial to nonfinancial companies in your portfolios to never go
above 50%. Suppose that you have six assets with three financial companies (assets 1–3) and three
nonfinancial companies (assets 4–6). Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use setGroupRatio to set the
group constraints:

GA = [ true true true false false false ];   % financial companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];   % nonfinancial companies
p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setGroupRatio(p, GA, GB, [], 0.5);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupA)
disp(p.GroupB)
disp(p.UpperRatio)

In this example, you would set the LowerRatio property to be empty ([]).

Suppose that you want to add another group ratio constraint to ensure that the weights in odd-
numbered assets constitute at least 20% of the weights in nonfinancial assets your portfolio. You can
set up augmented group ratio matrices and introduce infinite bounds for unconstrained group ratio
bounds, or you can use the addGroupRatio function to build up group ratio constraints. For this
example, create another group matrix for the second group constraint:

p = PortfolioMAD;
GA = [ true true true false false false ];   % financial companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];   % nonfinancial companies
p = setGroupRatio(p, GA, GB, [], 0.5);

GA = [ true false true false true false ];   % odd-numbered companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];   % nonfinancial companies
p = addGroupRatio(p, GA, GB, 0.2);

disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupA)
disp(p.GroupB)
disp(p.LowerRatio)
disp(p.UpperRatio)
