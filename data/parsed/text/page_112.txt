pattern. Whether the market exhibits momentum in certain states is a test of the weak-form Efficient
Market Hypothesis (EMH). For heavily traded assets, such as the one used in this example (INTC),
the EMH is likely to hold over extended periods, and arbitrage opportunities quickly disappear.
However, failure of EMH can occur in some assets over short time intervals. A working trading
strategy divides a portion of the trading day, short enough to exhibit a degree of statistical
equilibrium, into a training period for estimating Q, using optimal hyperparameter settings and a
validation period on which to trade. For an implementation of such a strategy, see “Machine Learning
for Statistical Arbitrage III: Training, Tuning, and Prediction” on page 2-69.

Summary

This example begins with raw data on the LOB and transforms it into a summary (the Q matrix) of
statistical arbitrage opportunities. The analysis uses the mathematics of continuous-time Markov
chain models, first in recognizing the Poisson process of LOB interarrival times, then by discretizing
data into two-dimensional states representing the instantaneous position of the market. A description
of state transitions, derived empirically, leads to the possibility of an algorithmic trading strategy.
