This way works because the calls to the PortfolioMAD object are in this particular order. In this
case, the call to initialize AssetScenarios provides the dimensions for the problem. If you were to
do this step last, you would have to explicitly dimension the LowerBound property as follows:

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];

m = m/12;
C = C/12;

AssetScenarios = mvnrnd(m, C, 20000);

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = PortfolioMAD(p, 'LowerBound', zeros(size(m)));
p = PortfolioMAD(p, 'LowerBudget', 1, 'UpperBudget', 1);
p = setScenarios(p, AssetScenarios);

Note If you did not specify the size of LowerBound but, instead, input a scalar argument, the
PortfolioMAD object assumes that you are defining a single-asset problem and produces an error at
the call to set asset scenarios with four assets.

Shortcuts for Property Names

The PortfolioMAD object has shorter argument names that replace longer argument names
associated with specific properties of the PortfolioMAD object. For example, rather than enter
'AInequality', the PortfolioMAD object accepts the case-insensitive name 'ai' to set the
AInequality property in a PortfolioMAD object. Every shorter argument name corresponds with
a single property in the PortfolioMAD object. The one exception is the alternative argument name
