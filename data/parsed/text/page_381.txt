Perform Portfolio Optimization with a Turnover Constraint

How close can you get to this efficient frontier by only trading some of the portfolio? Assume that you
want to trade only a certain percentage of the portfolio to avoid too much turnover in your holdings.
This requirement imposes some nonlinear constraints on the problem and gives a problem with
multiple local minima. Even so, the Portfolio object solves the problem, and you specify the
turnover constraint using the setTurnover function.

P10 = setTurnover(P,0.10);
