Obtaining Efficient Portfolios for Target Risks

This example shows how to obtain efficient portfolios that have targeted portfolio risks using the
estimateFrontierByRisk function.

The estimateFrontierByRisk function accepts one or more target portfolio risks and obtains
efficient portfolios with the specified risks. Suppose that you have a universe of four assets where you
want to obtain efficient portfolios with target portfolio risks of 12%, 14%, and 16%.

m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
      0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
      0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
      0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];
 
 p = Portfolio;
 p = setAssetMoments(p, m, C);
 p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
 pwgt = estimateFrontierByRisk(p, [0.12, 0.14, 0.16]);

display(pwgt)

pwgt = 4×3

0.3984    0.2659    0.1416
    0.3064    0.3791    0.4474
    0.0882    0.1010    0.1131
    0.2071    0.2540    0.2979

Sometimes, you can request a risk for which no efficient portfolio exists. Based on the previous code,
suppose that you want a portfolio with 7% risk (individual assets in this universe have risks ranging
from 8% to 35%). It turns out that a portfolio with 7% risk cannot be formed with these four assets.
estimateFrontierByRisk warns if your target risks are outside the range of efficient portfolio
risks and replaces it with the endpoint of the efficient frontier closest to your target risk. The best
way to avoid this situation is to bracket your target portfolio risks with estimateFrontierLimits
and estimatePortRisk (see “Obtaining Endpoints of the Efficient Frontier” on page 4-102 and
“Obtaining Portfolio Risks and Returns” on page 4-122).

prsk = estimatePortRisk(p, p.estimateFrontierLimits);
display(prsk)

prsk = 2×1

0.0769
    0.3500

This result indicates that efficient portfolios have risks that range from 7.7% to 35%.

Starting with an initial portfolio, estimateFrontierByRisk also returns purchases and sales to get
from your initial portfolio to the target portfolios on the efficient frontier. For example, given an initial
portfolio in pwgt0, you can obtain purchases and sales from the example with target risks of 12%,
14%, and 16%:
