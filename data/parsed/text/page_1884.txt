CouponRate — Coupon rate
decimal

Coupon rate, specified as a scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector of decimal values.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date of fixed-coupon bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date of the fixed-coupon bond, specified as scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime
array, string array, or date character vectors. If supplied as a NINST-by-1 vector of dates, settlement
dates can be different, as long as they are before the Maturity date and HorizonDate.

To support existing code, bndtotalreturn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are
not recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date of fixed-coupon bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date of the fixed-coupon bond, specified as scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime
array, string array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, bndtotalreturn also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are
not recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

ReinvestRate — Reinvestment rate
decimal

Reinvestment rate (the rate earned by reinvesting the coupons), specified as scalar or a NINST-by-2
vector of decimal values.

Data Types: double

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [BondEquiv,EffectiveRate] =
bndtotalreturn(Price,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,ReinvestRate,'HorizonDate','1
5-Nov-2021')

HorizonDate — Investment horizon date
Maturity date (default) | datetime array | string array | date character vector

Investment horizon date, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'HorizonDate' and a
scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.

If HorizonDate is unspecified, the total return is calculated to Maturity.
