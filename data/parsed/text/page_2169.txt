Info.PrevParameters – NUMPARAMS-by-1 column vector of estimates for the model parameters
from the iteration just before the terminal iteration.

Least Squares Regression

Least squares regression is a statistical method used to estimate the relationships between variables.

Least squares regression is commonly employed in linear regression analysis to find the best-fitting
line through a set of data points. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squares of the differences
(residuals) between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
