higher in 1994 than in 1995, but the opposite is true for SG. More noticeably, the IG default rate
peaked after the 2001 recession, in 2002, whereas the peak for SG is in 2001. This suggests that
models for the dynamics of the IG and SG default rates could have important differences, a common
situation when working with different segments. The overall corporate default rate is by construction
a combination of the other two, and its pattern is closer to SG, most likely due to the relative
magnitude of SG versus IG.

Getting Default Rates for Different Time Periods

The default rates obtained are examples of point-in-time (PIT) rates, only the most recent information
is used to estimate them. On the other extreme, you can use all the migrations observed in the 25
years spanned by the dataset to estimate long-term, or through-the-cycle (TTC) default rates. Other
rates of interest are the average default rates over recession or expansion years.

All of these are easy to estimate with the example data and the same tools. For example, to estimate
the average transition probabilities over recession years, pass to transprobbytotals the totals
structures corresponding to the recession years only. You can use logical indexing, taking advantage
of the Recession variable. transprobbytotals aggregates the information over time and returns
the corresponding transition matrix.
