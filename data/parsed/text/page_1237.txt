In contrast, the second approach specifies the risk-neutral return as the historical time series of
Euribor yields. It therefore assumes a dynamic, yet deterministic, rate of return; this example does
not illustrate stochastic interest rates. To illustrate this dynamic effect, use the ts2func utility.

r = ts2func(yields,'Times',(0:nPeriods - 1)');

ts2func packages a specified time series array inside a callable function of time and state, and
synchronizes it with an optional time vector. For instance:

r(0,100)

ans = 
0.0470

evaluates the function at (t = 0, Xt = 100) and returns the first observed Euribor yield.

However, you can also evaluate the resulting function at any intermediate time t and state Xt:

r(7.5,200)

ans = 
0.0472

Furthermore, the following command produces the same result when called with time alone:

r(7.5)

ans = 
0.0472

The equivalence of these last two commands highlights some important features.

When you specify parameters as functions, they must evaluate properly when passed a scalar, real-
valued sample time (t), and an NVars-by-1 state vector (Xt). They must also generate an array of
appropriate dimensions, which in the first case is a scalar constant, and in the second case is a scalar,
piecewise constant function of time alone. You are not required to use either time (t) or state (Xt). In
the current example, the function evaluates properly when passed time followed by state, thereby
satisfying the minimal requirements. The fact that it also evaluates correctly when passed only time
simply indicates that the function does not require the state vector Xt. The important point to make is
that it works when you pass it t, Xt .

Furthermore, the ts2func function performs a zero-order-hold (ZOH) piecewise constant
interpolation. The notion of piecewise constant parameters is pervasive throughout the SDE
