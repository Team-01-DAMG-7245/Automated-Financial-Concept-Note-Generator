Regressions

Each regression function has a specific operation. This section shows how to use these functions to
perform specific types of regressions. To illustrate use of the functions for various regressions,
“typical” usage is shown with optional arguments kept to a minimum. For a typical regression, you
estimate model parameters and residual covariance matrices with the mle functions and estimate the
standard errors of model parameters with the std functions. The regressions “without missing data”
essentially ignore samples with any missing values, and the regressions “with missing data” ignore
samples with every value missing.

Multivariate Normal Regression

Multivariate normal regression, or MVNR, is the “standard” implementation of the regression
functions in Financial Toolbox software.

Multivariate Normal Regression Without Missing Data

Estimate parameters using mvnrmle:

[Parameters, Covariance] = mvnrmle(Data, Design);

Estimate standard errors using mvnrstd:

StdParameters = mvnrstd(Data, Design, Covariance);
