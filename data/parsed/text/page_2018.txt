cfprice

Compute price for cash flow given yield to maturity

Syntax

Price = cfprice(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,Yield,Settle)
Price = cfprice( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Price = cfprice(CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,Yield,Settle) computes a price given yield
for a cash flow.

Price = cfprice( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more name-value pair
arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

Examples

Compute the Price for a Cash Flow Given Yield to Maturity

Use cfprice to compute the price for a cash flow given yield to maturity.

Define data for the yield curve.

Settle = datetime(2003,7,1);
Yield = .05;
CFAmounts = [30;40;30];
CFDates = [datetime(2004,7,15) ; datetime(2005,7,15) ; datetime(2006,7,15)];

Compute the Price.

Price = cfprice(CFAmounts, CFDates, Yield, Settle)

Price = 3×1

28.4999
   36.1689
   25.8195

Input Arguments

CFlowAmounts — Cash flow amounts
vector

Cash flow amounts, specified as an NINST-by-MOSTCFS matrix. Each row is a list of cash flow values
for one instrument. If an instrument has fewer than MOSTCFS cash flows, the end of the row is padded
with NaNs.
