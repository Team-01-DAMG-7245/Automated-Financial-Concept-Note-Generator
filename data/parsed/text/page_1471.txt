sdeddo

Stochastic Differential Equation (SDEDDO) model from Drift and Diffusion components

Description

Creates and displays a sdeddo object, instantiated with objects of class drift and diffusion. The
restricted sdeddo object contains the input drift and diffusion objects; therefore, you can
directly access their displayed parameters.

This abstraction also generalizes the notion of drift and diffusion-rate objects as functions that
sdeddo evaluates for specific values of time t and state Xt. Like sde objects, sdeddo objects allow
you to simulate sample paths of NVars state variables driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources
of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods, approximating continuous-time stochastic
processes.

This method enables you to simulate any vector-valued SDEDDO of the form:

dXt = F(t, Xt)dt + G(t, Xt)dWt
 (15-3)

where:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
F is an NVars-by-1 vector-valued drift-rate function.

•
G is an NVars-by-NBrowns matrix-valued diffusion-rate function.

Creation

Syntax

SDEDDO = sdeddo(DriftRate,DiffusionRate)
SDEDDO = sdeddo( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

SDEDDO = sdeddo(DriftRate,DiffusionRate) creates a default SDEDDO object.

SDEDDO = sdeddo( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a SDEDDO object with additional options specified
by one or more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN.

The SDEDDO object has the following displayed “Properties” on page 15-167:

•
StartTime — Initial observation time
