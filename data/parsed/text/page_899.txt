Tip To correct this problem, try solving your problem with larger values for turnover and gradually
reduce to the value that you want.

Efficient Portfolios Do Not Make Sense

If you obtain efficient portfolios that, do not seem to make sense, this can happen if you forget to set
specific constraints or you set incorrect constraints. For example, if you allow portfolio weights to fall
between 0 and 1 and do not set a budget constraint, you can get portfolios that are 100% invested in
every asset. Although it may be hard to detect, the best thing to do is to review the constraints you
have set with display of the PortfolioMAD object. If you get portfolios with 100% invested in each
asset, you can review the display of your object and quickly see that no budget constraint is set. Also,
you can use estimateBounds and checkFeasibility to determine if the bounds for your portfolio
set make sense and to determine if the portfolios you obtained are feasible relative to an independent
formulation of your portfolio set.
