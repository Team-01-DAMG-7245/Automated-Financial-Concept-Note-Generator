The figure shows that the two Portfolio objects have almost identical efficient frontiers. However,
the one with the minimum weight requirement is more practical, since it prevents the close-to-zero
positions.

Check the optimal weights for the portfolio with default constraints to see how many assets are below
the 5% limit for each optimal allocation.

toler = eps;
sum(wgt>toler & wgt<0.05)

ans = 1Ã—10

5     7     5     4     2     3     4     2     0     0

Use estimateFrontierByReturn to investigate the portfolio compositions for a target return on
the frontier for both cases.

targetRetn = 0.011;
pwgt = estimateFrontierByReturn(p, targetRetn);
pwgtWithMinWeight = estimateFrontierByReturn(pWithMinWeight, targetRetn);

Plot the composition of the two Portfolio objects for the universe of 30 assets.
