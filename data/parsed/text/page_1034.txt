hPlotTransitions(CompanyID,startDate,endDate,data,RatingLabels)

To understand how transprob handles data when the first observed date is after the start date of
the analysis, or whose last observed date occurs before the end date of the analysis, consider the
following example. For company 'ABC' suppose that the analysis has a start date of 31-Dec-2014
and end date of 31-Dec-2017. There are only two transitions reported for this company for that
analysis time window. The first observation for 'ABC' happened on 17-Feb-2015. So the 31-
Dec-2015 snapshot is the first time the company is observed. By 31-Dec-2016, the company
remained in the original 'AA' rating. By 31-Dec-2017, a downgrade to 'A' is recorded. Consistent
with this, the transition counts show one transition from 'AA' to 'AA' (from the end of 2015 to the
end of 2016), and one transition from 'AA' to 'A' (from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017). The plot
shows the last rating as a dotted red line to emphasize that the last rating in the data is extrapolated
indefinitely into the future. There is no extrapolation into the past; the company's history is ignored
until a company rating is known for an entire transition period (31-Dec-2015 through 31-Dec-2016
in the case of 'ABC').
