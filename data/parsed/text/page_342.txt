Dollar-Neutral Hedge-Fund Structure

To illustrate how to use the portfolio optimization tools in hedge fund management, two popular
strategies with dollar-neutral and 130-30 portfolios are examined. The dollar-neutral strategy invests
equally in long and short positions such that the net portfolio position is 0. Such a portfolio is said to
be "dollar-neutral."

To set up a dollar-neutral portfolio, start with the "standard" portfolio problem and set the maximum
exposure in long and short positions in the variable Exposure. The bounds for individual asset
weights are plus or minus Exposure. Since the net position must be dollar-neutral, the budget
constraint is 0 and the initial portfolio must be 0. Finally, the one-way turnover constraints provide
the necessary long and short restrictions to prevent "double-counting" of long and short positions.
The blotter shows the portfolio weights for the dollar-neutral portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe
ratio. The long and short positions are obtained from the buy and sell trades relative to the initial
portfolio.

Exposure = 1;

q = setBounds(p, -Exposure, Exposure);
q = setBudget(q, 0, 0);
q = setOneWayTurnover(q, Exposure, Exposure, 0);

[qwgt,qlong,qshort] = estimateFrontier(q,20);
[qrsk,qret] = estimatePortMoments(q,qwgt);

[qswgt,qslong,qsshort] = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(q);
[qsrsk,qsret] = estimatePortMoments(q,qswgt);
