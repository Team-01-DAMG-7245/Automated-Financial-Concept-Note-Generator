Input Arguments

obj — Object for portfolio
object

Object for portfolio, specified using a Portfolio object.

Note The risk-free rate is obtained from the property RiskFreeRate in the Portfolio object. If you
leave the RiskFreeRate unset, it is assumed to be 0. For more information on creating a portfolio
object, see Portfolio.

Data Types: object

pwgt — Collection of portfolios
matrix

Collection of portfolios, specified as a NumAssets-by- NumPorts matrix where NumAssets is the
number of assets in the universe and NumPorts is the number of portfolios in the collection of
portfolios.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

psharpe — Sharpe ratios of the given portfolios
vector

Sharpe ratios of the given portfolios, returned as a NumPorts-by-1 vector.

More About

Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio is the ratio of the difference between the mean of portfolio returns and the risk-free
rate divided by the standard deviation of portfolio returns for each portfolio in pwgt.

estimatePortSharpeRatio computes the Sharpe ratio with mean and standard deviation (which is
the square-root of variance) of portfolio returns.
