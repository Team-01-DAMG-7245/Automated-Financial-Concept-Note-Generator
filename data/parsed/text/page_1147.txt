Hedge Using Monte Carlo Simulation

This example shows how to use Monte Carlo simulation to model the probability of different outcomes
in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables.

Define Stock Profile

Assume the following specification for a stock.

% Price at time 0
Price_0 = 200;

% Drift (annualized)
Drift = 0.08;

% Volatility (annualized)
Vol = 0.4;

% Valuation date
Valuation = '01-Jan-2012';

% Investment horizon date
Horizon = '01-Jan-2013';

% Risk free rate
RiskFreeRate = 0.03;

Use Monte Carlo Simulation

Simulate this stock's price movements from the valuation date to the Horizon date.

% Number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation
NTRIALS = 100000;

% Length (in years) of the simulation
T = date2time(Valuation,Horizon,1,1);

% Number of periods per trial. Approximately 100 periods per year.
NPERIODS = round(100*T);

% Length (in years) of each time step per period
dt = T/NPERIODS;

% Instantiate the GBM object
StockGBM = gbm(Drift,Vol,'StartState',Price_0);

% Run the simulation
Paths = StockGBM.simByEuler(NPERIODS,'NTRIALS',NTRIALS, ...
    'DeltaTime',dt,'Antithetic',true);

Plot Stock Simulation

For efficiency, only plot some scenarios.

plot(squeeze(Paths(:,:,1:500)));
