NextCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   31-May-1997
   10-Jun-1998

Compute the next quasi coupon dates for these two bonds.

NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq(Settle, Maturity)

NextQuasiCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   31-May-1997
   10-Jun-1998

Because no FirstCouponDate has been specified, the results are identical.

Now supply an explicit FirstCouponDate for each bond.

FirstCouponDate = [datetime(1997,11,30), datetime(1998,12,10)];

Compute the next coupon dates.

NextCouponDate = cpndaten(Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, 1, [],FirstCouponDate)

NextCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   30-Nov-1997
   10-Dec-1998

The next coupon dates are identical to the specified first coupon dates.

Now recompute the next quasi coupon dates.

NextQuasiCouponDate = cpndatenq(Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, 1, [],FirstCouponDate)

NextQuasiCouponDate = 2×1 datetime
   31-May-1997
   10-Jun-1998

These results illustrate the distinction between actual coupon payment dates and quasi coupon dates.
FirstCouponDate (and LastCouponDate, as well), when specified, is associated with an actual
coupon payment and also serves as the synchronization date for determining all quasi coupon dates.
Since each bond in this example pays semiannual coupons, and the first coupon date occurs more
than six months after settlement, each will have an intermediate quasi coupon date before the actual
first coupon payment occurs.

Input Arguments

Settle — Settlement date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. Settle must be earlier than Maturity.

To support existing code, cpndatenq also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.
