Alternatively, the setSolver function accepts an optimoptions object as the second argument. For
example, you can change the algorithm to 'active-set' with no displayed output as follows:

p = PortfolioMAD;
options = optimoptions('fmincon', 'Algorithm', 'active-set', 'Display', 'off');
p = setSolver(p, 'fmincon', options);
display(p.solverOptions.Algorithm)
display(p.solverOptions.Display)

Using the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) Solver

The mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) solver, configured using setSolverMINLP,
enables you to specify associated solver options for portfolio optimization for a PortfolioMAD
object. The MINLP solver is used when any one, or any combination of 'Conditional' BoundType,
MinNumAssets, or MaxNumAssets constraints are active, the portfolio problem is formulated by
adding NumAssets binary variables, where 0 indicates not invested, and 1 is invested. For more
information on using 'Conditional' BoundType, see setBounds. For more information on
specifying MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets, see setMinMaxNumAssets.

When using the estimate functions with a PortfolioMAD object where 'Conditional'
BoundType, MinNumAssets, or MaxNumAssets constraints are active, the mixed integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) solver is automatically used.
