cfamounts

Cash flow and time mapping for bond portfolio

Syntax

[CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,TFactors,CFlowFlags,CFPrincipal] = cfamounts(
CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)
[CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,TFactors,CFlowFlags,CFPrincipal] = cfamounts( ___ ,
Name,Value)

Description

[CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,TFactors,CFlowFlags,CFPrincipal] = cfamounts(
CouponRate,Settle,Maturity) returns matrices of cash flow amounts, cash flow dates, time
factors, and cash flow flags for a portfolio of NUMBONDS fixed-income securities.

The elements contained in the cfamounts outputs for the cash flow matrix, time factor matrix, and
cash flow flag matrix correspond to the cash flow dates for each security. The first element of each
row in the cash flow matrix is the accrued interest payable on each bond. This accrued interest is
zero in the case of all zero coupon bonds. cfamounts determines all cash flows and time mappings
for a bond whether or not the coupon structure contains odd first or last periods. All output matrices
are padded with NaNs as necessary to ensure that all rows have the same number of elements.

[CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,TFactors,CFlowFlags,CFPrincipal] = cfamounts( ___ ,
Name,Value) adds optional name-value arguments.

Examples

Compute the Cash Flow Structure and Time Factors for a Bond Portfolio

This example shows how to compute the cash flow structure and time factors for a bond portfolio that
contains a corporate bond paying interest quarterly and a Treasury bond paying interest
semiannually.

Settle = '01-Nov-1993';
Maturity = ['15-Dec-1994';'15-Jun-1995'];
CouponRate= [0.06; 0.05];
Period = [4; 2];
Basis = [1; 0];
[CFlowAmounts, CFlowDates, TFactors, CFlowFlags] = ...
cfamounts(CouponRate,Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis)

CFlowAmounts = 2×6

-0.7667    1.5000    1.5000    1.5000    1.5000  101.5000
   -1.8989    2.5000    2.5000    2.5000  102.5000       NaN
