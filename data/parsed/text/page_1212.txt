   Class DRIFT: Drift Rate Specification  
   -------------------------------------  
      Rate: drift rate function F(t,X(t)) 
         A: 0
         B: 0.1

G = diffusion(1, 0.3)  % Diffusion rate function G(t,X)

G = 
   Class DIFFUSION: Diffusion Rate Specification

      Sigma: 0.3

Each object displays like a MATLAB® structure and contains supplemental information, namely, the
object's class and a brief description. However, in contrast to the SDE representation, a summary of
the dimensionality of the model does not appear, because drift and diffusion objects create
model components rather than models. Neither F nor G contains enough information to characterize
the dimensionality of a problem.

The drift object's displayed parameters are:

•
Rate: The drift-rate function, F t, Xt

•
A: The intercept term, A t, Xt , of F t, Xt

•
B: The first order term, B t, Xt , of F t, Xt

A and B enable you to query the original inputs. The function stored in Rate fully encapsulates the
combined effect of A and B.

The diffusion object's displayed parameters are:

•
Rate: The diffusion-rate function, G t, Xt

•
Alpha: The state vector exponent, which determines the format of D t, Xt  of G t, Xt

•
Sigma: The volatility rate, V t, Xt , of G t, Xt

Again, Alpha and Sigma enable you to query the original inputs. (The combined effect of the
individual Alpha and Sigma parameters is fully encapsulated by the function stored in Rate.) The
Rate functions are the calculation engines for the drift and diffusion objects, and are the only
parameters required for simulation.

Specify SDEDDO with Drift and Diffusion Functions

The sdeddo object derives from the base sde object. To use this object, you must pass drift and
diffusion objects to sdeddo.

Create drift and diffusion rate objects.
