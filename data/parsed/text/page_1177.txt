Use Timetables in Finance

Use timetables to visualize and calculate weekly statistics from simulated daily stock data.

Step 1. Load the data.

The data for this example is in the MAT-file SimulatedStock.mat, which loads the following:

•
Dates corresponding to the closing stock prices, TMW_DATES

•
Opening stock prices, TMW_OPEN

•
Daily high of stock prices, TMW_HIGH

•
Daily low of stock prices, TMW_LOW

•
Closing stock prices, TMW_CLOSE, TMW_CLOSE_MISSING

•
Daily volume of traded, TMW_VOLUME

•
Data in a table, TMW_TB

load SimulatedStock.mat TMW_*

Step 2. Create timetables.

In timetables, you can work with financial time series rather than with vectors. When using a
timetable, you can easily track the dates. You can manipulate the data series based on the dates,
because a timetable object tracks the administration of a time series.

Use the MATLAB® timetable function to create a timetable object. Alternatively, you can use the
MATLAB conversion function table2timetable to convert a table to a timetable. In this example,
the timetable TMW_TT is constructed from a table and is only for illustration purposes. After you
create a timetable object, you can use the Description field of the timetable object to store
meta-information about the timetable.

% Create a timetable from vector input
TMW = timetable(TMW_OPEN,TMW_HIGH,TMW_LOW,TMW_CLOSE_MISSING,TMW_VOLUME, ... 
    'VariableNames',{'Open','High','Low','Close','Volume'},'RowTimes',TMW_DATES);

% Convert from a table to a timetable
TMW_TT = table2timetable(TMW_TB,'RowTimes',TMW_DATES);

TMW.Properties.Description = 'Simulated stock data.';

TMW.Properties

ans = 
  TimetableProperties with properties:

Description: 'Simulated stock data.'
                UserData: []
          DimensionNames: {'Time'  'Variables'}
           VariableNames: {'Open'  'High'  'Low'  'Close'  'Volume'}
           VariableTypes: ["double"    "double"    "double"    "double"    "double"]
    VariableDescriptions: {}
           VariableUnits: {}
      VariableContinuity: []
                RowTimes: [1000×1 datetime]
