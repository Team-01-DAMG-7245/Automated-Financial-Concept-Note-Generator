Refer to the MATLAB set command for information on modifying the axis tick values and other axis
parameters.

Data Types: double

StartDate â€” Assigns the date to the first axis tick value
lower axis limit converted to the appropriate date number (default) | datetime scalar | string scalar |
date character vector

(Optional) Assigns the date to the first axis tick value, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date
character vector.

The default StartDate is the lower axis limit converted to the appropriate date number. For
example, a tick value of 1 is converted to the date 01-Jan-0000. Entering StartDate as '06-
apr-1999' assigns the date April 6, 1999 to the first tick value and the axis tick labels are set
accordingly.

To support existing code, dateaxis also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although dateaxis supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)
