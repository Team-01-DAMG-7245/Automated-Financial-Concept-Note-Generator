Credit Scorecards with Constrained Logistic Regression
Coefficients

To compute scores for a creditscorecard object with constraints for equality, inequality, or bounds
on the coefficients of the logistic regression model, use fitConstrainedModel. Unlike fitmodel,
fitConstrainedModel solves for both the unconstrained and constrained problem. The current
solver used to minimize an objective function for fitConstrainedModel is fmincon, from the
Optimization Toolbox™.

This example has three main sections. First, fitConstrainedModel is used to solve for the
coefficients in the unconstrained model. Then, fitConstrainedModel demonstrates how to use
several types of constraints. Finally, fitConstrainedModel uses bootstrapping for the significance
analysis to determine which predictors to reject from the model.

Create the creditscorecard Object and Bin data

load CreditCardData.mat
sc = creditscorecard(data,'IDVar','CustID');
sc = autobinning(sc);

Unconstrained Model Using fitConstrainedModel

Solve for the unconstrained coefficients using fitConstrainedModel with default values for the
input parameters. fitConstrainedModel uses the internal optimization solver fmincon from the
Optimization Toolbox™. If you do not set any constraints, fmincon treats the model as an
unconstrained optimization problem. The default parameters for the LowerBound and UpperBound
are -Inf and +Inf, respectively. For the equality and inequality constraints, the default is an empty
numeric array.

[sc1,mdl1] = fitConstrainedModel(sc);
coeff1 = mdl1.Coefficients.Estimate;
disp(mdl1.Coefficients);

Unlike fitmodel which gives p-values, when using fitConstrainedModel, you must use
bootstrapping to find out which predictors are rejected from the model, when subject to constraints.
This is illustrated in the "Significance Bootstrapping" section.
