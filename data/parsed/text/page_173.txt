same return proxies and portfolio sets as mean-variance portfolio optimization but uses
conditional value-at-risk of portfolio returns as the risk proxy.

•
The PortfolioMAD object implements what is known as mean-absolute deviation portfolio
optimization (see Konno and Yamazaki [50] at “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5), which is
referred to as MAD portfolio optimization. MAD portfolio optimization works with the same return
proxies and portfolio sets as mean-variance portfolio optimization but uses mean-absolute
deviation portfolio returns as the risk proxy.

Return Proxy

The proxy for portfolio return is a function μ: X
R on a portfolio set X ⊂Rn that characterizes the
rewards associated with portfolio choices. Usually, the proxy for portfolio return has two general
forms, gross and net portfolio returns. Both portfolio return forms separate the risk-free rate r0 so
that the portfolio x ∈X contains only risky assets.

Regardless of the underlying distribution of asset returns, a collection of S asset returns y1,...,yS has a
mean of asset returns

m = 1
S ∑
s = 1

S
ys,

and (sample) covariance of asset returns

C =
1
S −1 ∑
s = 1

S
(ys −m)(ys −m)T .

These moments (or alternative estimators that characterize these moments) are used directly in
mean-variance portfolio optimization to form proxies for portfolio risk and return.

Gross Portfolio Returns

The gross portfolio return for a portfolio x ∈X is

μ(x) = r0 + (m −r01)Tx,

where:

r0 is the risk-free rate (scalar).

m is the mean of asset returns (n vector).

If the portfolio weights sum to 1, the risk-free rate is irrelevant. The properties in the Portfolio
object to specify gross portfolio returns are:

•
RiskFreeRate for r0
•
AssetMean for m

Net Portfolio Returns

The net portfolio return for a portfolio x ∈X is

μ(x) = r0 + (m −r01)Tx −bTmax 0, x −x0 −sTmax 0, x0 −x ,
