Working with Average Turnover Constraints Using
PortfolioMAD Object

The turnover constraint is an optional linear absolute value constraint (see “Average Turnover
Constraints” on page 6-13) that enforces an upper bound on the average of purchases and sales. The
turnover constraint can be set using the PortfolioMAD object or the setTurnover function. The
turnover constraint depends on an initial or current portfolio, which is assumed to be zero if not set
when the turnover constraint is set. The turnover constraint has properties Turnover, for the upper
bound on average turnover, and InitPort, for the portfolio against which turnover is computed.

Setting Average Turnover Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD
Function

The properties for the turnover constraints are set using the PortfolioMAD object. Suppose that you
have an initial portfolio of 10 assets in a variable x0 and you want to ensure that average turnover is
no more than 30%. To set this turnover constraint:

x0 = [ 0.12; 0.09; 0.08; 0.07; 0.1; 0.1; 0.15; 0.11; 0.08; 0.1 ]; 
p = PortfolioMAD('Turnover', 0.3, 'InitPort', x0);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.Turnover)
disp(p.InitPort)

Note if the NumAssets or InitPort properties are not set before or when the turnover constraint is
set, various rules are applied to assign default values to these properties (see “Setting Up an Initial or
Current Portfolio” on page 6-33).

Setting Average Turnover Constraints Using the setTurnover Function

You can also set properties for portfolio turnover using setTurnover to specify both the upper
bound for average turnover and an initial portfolio. Suppose that you have an initial portfolio of 10
assets in a variable x0 and want to ensure that average turnover is no more than 30%. Given a
PortfolioMAD object p, use setTurnover to set the turnover constraint with and without the initial
portfolio being set previously:

x0 = [ 0.12; 0.09; 0.08; 0.07; 0.1; 0.1; 0.15; 0.11; 0.08; 0.1 ];
p = PortfolioMAD('InitPort', x0);
p = setTurnover(p, 0.3);
