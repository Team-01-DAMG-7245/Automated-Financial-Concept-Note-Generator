Create an annualized zero-rate term structure to calculate the zero discount margin.

Rates = [0.0500;
         0.0505;
         0.0510;
         0.0520];
StartDates = [datetime(2011,1,20);
              datetime(2011,4,15);
              datetime(2011,7,15);
              datetime(2011,11,15)];
EndDates =   [datetime(2011,4,15);
              datetime(2011,7,15);
              datetime(2011,11,15);
              datetime(2012,1,15)];
ValuationDate = datetime(2011,1,20);
RateSpec = intenvset('Compounding', Reset, 'Rates', Rates,...
'StartDates', StartDates, 'EndDates', EndDates,...
'ValuationDate', ValuationDate, 'Basis', Basis);

Calculate the zero discount margin using the previous yield curve.

dMargin = floatdiscmargin(Price, Spread, Settle, Maturity, ...
RateSpec, LatestFloatingRate,'Reset', Reset, 'Basis', Basis, ...
'AdjustCashFlowsBasis', true)

dMargin = 
46.0689

Input Arguments

Price — Bond prices where discount margin is to be computed
matrix

Bond prices where discount margin is to be computed, specified as a NINST-by-1 matrix.

Note The spread is calculated against the clean price (the function internally does not add the
accrued interest to the price specified by the Price input). If the spread is required against the dirty
price, the price of a bond that includes the accrued interest, you must supply the dirty price for the
Price input.

Data Types: double

Spread — Number of basis points over the reference rate
numeric

Number of basis points over the reference rate, specified as a NINST-by-1 matrix.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date of the floating-rate bonds
datetime array | string array | date character vector
