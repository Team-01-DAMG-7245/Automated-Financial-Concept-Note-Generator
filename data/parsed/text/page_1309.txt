•
Period — Column vector of positive whole numbers containing the time Period numbers. For
each one of the NumAssets asset names, the Period numbers range from 1 to NumPeriods with
increments of 1, so that there are a total of NumAssets-times-NumPeriods rows. Row 1 is for the
first period, row 2 is for the second period, and is repeated for each asset. If the Period column is
missing from AssetTable, all Period numbers are internally set to 1 and all asset returns in
AssetTable are assumed to be for the same single period.

•
Name — String column vector containing the individual asset names for the associated returns.
There is a total of NumAssets unique names, and the names are repeated for each Period.

•
Return — Numeric column vector containing the asset returns in decimals.

•
Category — Categorical vector containing the asset categories (sectors) for the associated asset
returns. There is a total of NumCategories unique categories.

•
Portfolio Weight — Numeric vector containing the asset portfolio weights in decimals. The
weights are internally normalized so that they sum to 1 for each Period.

Note The values for Portfolio Weight must sum to 1 for the Brinson model. If the weights do
not sum to 1, the Portfolio Weight values are internally normalized so that they sum to 1 and
brinsonAttribution displays a warning. If there is a cash position, you must account for it as
an asset with its own weight so that the weights sum to 1.

•
Benchmark Weight — Numeric vector containing the asset benchmark weights in decimals. The
weights are internally normalized so that they sum to 1 for each Period.

Note The values for the Benchmark Weight must sum to 1 for the Brinson model. If the weights
do not sum to 1, the Benchmark Weight values are internally normalized so that they sum to 1
and brinsonAttribution displays a warning. If there is a cash position, you must account for it
as an asset with its own weight so that the weights sum to 1.

Note AssetTable must be a table. Instead of specific dates and times, the Period column of
AssetTable must have period numbers that start with 1 and have increments of one. The
multiperiod Brinson model assumes that all returns are for time periods of equal intervals (for
example, monthly, quarterly, and so on).

Each individual asset must belong to one and only one category. You can apply Brinson attribution to
any portfolio containing assets with measured returns if each of the individual asset belongs to one
and only one category. Therefore, you can include a bond or cash holding in the portfolio after
assigning it to its own category (for example, "Bond" or "Cash") and you enter its measured returns
and weights. If the portfolio's benchmark does not have the bond or cash holding, then the
benchmark weight for that asset is 0. As for an ETF, you can decompose the ETF into its individual
holdings (for example, about 100 stocks in QQQ) and then enter these stocks into the portfolio with
the associated measured returns, weights (relative to the overall portfolio, not within the ETF) and
associate each stock in the ETF with a category.
