Backtest Workflow

Backtesting a portfolio of investments refers to the process of applying a trading strategy to historical
or simulated market data to determine how accurately the strategy would have predicted actual
results.

The steps of the backtesting workflow are:

•
Strategy definition — Clearly define the investment strategy, including the selection criteria for
assets, the timing of buy and sell decisions, portfolio rebalancing rules, risk management
techniques, and any other relevant parameters using backtestStrategy.

•
Create backtest engine — Use backtestEngine to create the framework designed to facilitate
the backtesting of investment strategies using historical data.
