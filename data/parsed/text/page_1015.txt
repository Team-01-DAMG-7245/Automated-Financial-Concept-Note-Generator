Based on the plot, you can reject 'UtilRate' since it has the highest number of zero values. You can
also decide to reject 'TmAtAddress' since it shows a peak, albeit small.

Set the Corresponding Coefficients to Zero

To set the corresponding coefficients to zero, set their upper bound to zero and solve the model again
using the original data set.

ub(3) = 0;
ub(end) = 0;
[sc,mdl] = fitConstrainedModel(sc,'AInequality',AIneq,'bInequality',bIneq,'LowerBound',lb,'UpperB
Ind = (abs(mdl.Coefficients.Estimate) <= Tol);
ModelCoeff = mdl.Coefficients.Estimate(~Ind);
ModelPreds = mdl.Coefficients.Properties.RowNames(~Ind)';
