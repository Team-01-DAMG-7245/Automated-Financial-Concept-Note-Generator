getBudget

Obtain budget constraint bounds from portfolio object

Syntax

[LowerBudget,UpperBudget] = getBudget(obj)

Description

Use the getBudget function with a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object to
obtain budget constraint bounds from portfolio objects.

For details on the respective workflows when using these different objects, see “Portfolio Object
Workflow” on page 4-18, “PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16, and “PortfolioMAD Object
Workflow” on page 6-16.

[LowerBudget,UpperBudget] = getBudget(obj) obtains budget constraint bounds from
portfolio objects.

Examples

Obtain Values for Lower and Upper Budgets for a Portfolio Object

Given portfolio p with the default constraints set, obtain the values for LowerBudget and
UpperBudget.

p = Portfolio;
p = setDefaultConstraints(p, 5);
[LowerBudget, UpperBudget] = getBudget(p)

LowerBudget = 
1

UpperBudget = 
1

Obtain Values for Lower and Upper Budgets for a PortfolioCVaR Object

Given a PortfolioCVaR object p with the default constraints set, obtain the values for LowerBudget
and UpperBudget.

p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setDefaultConstraints(p, 5);
[LowerBudget, UpperBudget] = getBudget(p)

LowerBudget = 
1
