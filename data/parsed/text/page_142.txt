Note An alternative to using these portfolio optimization functions is to use the Portfolio object
(Portfolio) for mean-variance portfolio optimization. This object supports gross or net portfolio
returns as the return proxy, the variance of portfolio returns as the risk proxy, and a portfolio set that
is any combination of the specified constraints to form a portfolio set. For information on the
workflow when using Portfolio objects, see “Portfolio Object Workflow” on page 4-18.
