More About

Multivariate Normal Regression

Multivariate normal regression is a statistical modeling approach that extends traditional regression
techniques to situations where the dependent variable is multivariate, meaning it consists of multiple
correlated outcomes.

Multivariate normal regression is particularly useful in fields where researchers are interested in
understanding the relationships between several response variables and one or more predictor
variables.
