Decompose Prices and Cluster Commodities

Decompose each commodity price series into a long-term trend, a seasonal component, and an
irregular (or business cycle) component. This operation is an additive decomposition:

Pt = Lt + St + Ct,
t = 1, 2, 3, …,

where:

•
Pt is the commodity price series.

•
Lt is the long-term trend.

•
St is the seasonal component (which may be the sum of multiple seasonal trends).

•
Ct is the irregular component.

Based on the relative similarity of the irregular components of the commodity price series, you can
cluster the commodities into groups using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

Decompose Commodity Prices

Preallocate variables for the soft commodity series components.

numObservations = height( Prices );
numCommodities = width( Prices );

longTermComponent = NaN( numObservations, numCommodities );
seasonalComponent = NaN( numObservations, numCommodities );
