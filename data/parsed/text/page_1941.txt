Data Types: double | object

ProbData — Default probability values
matrix

Default probability values, specified as a P-by-2 matrix with dates, using a serial date number format,
and corresponding cumulative default probability values.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. The Settle date
must be earlier than or equal to the dates in Maturity.

To support existing code, cdsspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date, specified as a N-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors.

To support existing code, cdsspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Note Any optional input of size N-by-1 is also acceptable as an array of size 1-by-N, or as a single
value applicable to all contracts. Single values are internally expanded to an array of size N-by-1.

Example: Spread =
cdsspread(ZeroData,ProbData,Settle,Maturity,'Basis',7,'BusinessDayConvention'
,'previous')

RecoveryRate — Recovery rate
0.4 (default) | decimal

Recovery rate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RecoveryRate' and a N-by-1
vector of recovery rates, specified as a decimal from 0 to 1.
