If you did not specify the size of LowerBound but, instead, input a scalar argument, the Portfolio
object assumes that you are defining a single-asset problem and produces an error at the call to set
asset moments with four assets.

Shortcuts for Property Names

The Portfolio object has shorter argument names that replace longer argument names associated
with specific properties of the Portfolio object. For example, rather than enter 'assetcovar', the
Portfolio object accepts the case-insensitive name 'covar' to set the AssetCovar property in a
Portfolio object. Every shorter argument name corresponds with a single property in the
Portfolio object. The one exception is the alternative argument name 'budget', which signifies
both the LowerBudget and UpperBudget properties. When 'budget' is used, then the
LowerBudget and UpperBudget properties are set to the same value to form an equality budget
constraint.
