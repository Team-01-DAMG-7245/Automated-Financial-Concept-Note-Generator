Introduction

Credit ratings rank borrowers according to their credit worthiness. Though this ranking is, in itself,
useful, institutions are also interested in knowing how likely it is that borrowers in a particular rating
category will be upgraded or downgraded to a different rating, and especially, how likely it is that
they will default.

Transition probabilities offer one way to characterize the past changes in credit quality of obligors
(typically firms), and are cardinal inputs to many risk management applications. Financial Toolbox
software supports the estimation of transition probabilities using both cohort and duration (also
known as hazard rate or intensity) approaches using transprob and related functions.

Note The sample dataset used throughout this section is simulated using a single transition matrix.
No attempt is made to match historical trends in transition rates.

Estimate Transition Probabilities

This example shows how to estimate transition probabilities using sample credit ratings data.

Use the Data_TransProb.mat file that contains sample credit ratings data.

load Data_TransProb
data(1:10,:)

ans=10×3 table
         ID              Date          Rating 
    ____________    _______________    _______

{'00010283'}    {'10-Nov-1984'}    {'CCC'}
    {'00010283'}    {'12-May-1986'}    {'B'  }
