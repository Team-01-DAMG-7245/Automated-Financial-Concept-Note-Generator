The Brownian interpolation within the chosen interval, dt, illustrates the following:

•
The conditional mean of each state variable lies on a straight-line segment between the original
simulated states at each endpoint.

•
The conditional variance of each state variable is a quadratic function. This function attains its
maximum midway between the interval endpoints, and is zero at each endpoint.

•
The maximum variance, although dependent upon the actual model diffusion-rate function G(t,X),
is the variance of the sum of NBrowns correlated Gaussian variates scaled by the factor dt/4.

The previous plot highlights interpolation without refinement, in that none of the interpolated states
take into account new information as it becomes available. If you had performed interpolation with
refinement, new interpolated states would have been inserted into the time series and made available
to subsequent interpolations on a trial-by-trial basis. In this case, all random draws for any given
interpolation time would be identical. Also, the plot of the sample mean would exhibit greater
variability, but would still cluster around the straight-line segment between the original simulated
states at each endpoint. The plot of the sample variance, however, would be zero for all interpolation
times, exhibiting no variability.

Input Arguments

MDL — Stochastic differential equation model
object

Stochastic differential equation model, specified as an sde, bm, gbm, cev, cir, hwv, heston, sdeddo,
sdeld, or sdemrd object.

All MDL parameters are assumed piecewise constant, evaluated from the most recent observation
time in Times that precedes a specified interpolation time in T. This is consistent with the Euler
approach of Monte Carlo simulation.
