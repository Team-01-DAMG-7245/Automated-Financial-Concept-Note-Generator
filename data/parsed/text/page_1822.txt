Input Arguments

ZeroData — Zero rate data
matrix | IRDataCurve object

Zero rate data, specified as an M-by-2 matrix of dates and zero rates or an IRDataCurve object of
zero rates. For array input, the dates must be entered as serial date numbers, and discount rate must
be in decimal form.

When ZeroData is an IRDataCurve object, ZeroCompounding and ZeroBasis are implicit in
ZeroData and are redundant inside this function. In this case, specify these optional parameters
when constructing the IRDataCurve object before using this bondDefaultBootstrap function.

For more information on an IRDataCurve object, see “Creating an IRDataCurve Object” (Financial
Instruments Toolbox).

Data Types: double

MarketData — Bond market data
matrix

Bond market data, specified as an N-by-3 matrix of maturity dates, market prices, and coupon rates
for bonds. The dates must be entered as serial date numbers, market prices must be numeric values,
and coupon rate must be in decimal form.

Note A warning is displayed when MarketData is not sorted in ascending order by time.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date
datetime scalar | string scalar | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a scalar datetime, string, or date character vector. Settle must be
earlier than or equal to the maturity dates in MarketData.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

Data Types: char | datetime | string
