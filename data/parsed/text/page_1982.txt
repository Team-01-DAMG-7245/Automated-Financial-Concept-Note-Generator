day conventions to be used in computing payment dates. The selection for business day convention
determines how nonbusiness days are treated. Nonbusiness days are defined as weekends plus any
other date that businesses are not open (for example, statutory holidays). Values are:

•
'actual' — Nonbusiness days are effectively ignored. Cash flows that fall on non-business days
are assumed to be distributed on the actual date.

•
'follow' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed on the
following business day.

•
'modifiedfollow' — Cash flows that fall on a non-business day are assumed to be distributed
on the following business day. However if the following business day is in a different month, the
previous business day is adopted instead.

•
'previous' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed on the
previous business day.

•
'modifiedprevious' — Cash flows that fall on a nonbusiness day are assumed to be distributed
on the previous business day. However if the previous business day is in a different month, the
following business day is adopted instead.

Data Types: char | cell

CompoundingFrequency — Compounding frequency for yield calculation
SIA uses2, ICMA uses 1 (default) | integer with value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12

Compounding frequency for yield calculation, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'CompoundingFrequency' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

Note By default, SIA bases (0-7) and BUS/252 use a semiannual compounding convention and ICMA
bases (8-12) use an annual compounding convention.

Data Types: double

DiscountBasis — Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield
SIA uses 0 (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Basis used to compute the discount factors for computing the yield, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'DiscountBasis' and a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)
