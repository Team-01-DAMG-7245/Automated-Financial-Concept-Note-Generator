The real part shows the trend in the absolute price series. When |pc(t − 1)| < |pc(t)|, that is, when
prices move away from zero, rc(t) has a positive real part. When |pc(t − 1)| > |pc(t)|, that is, when
prices move toward zero, rc(t) has a negative real part. When |pc(t − 1)| = |pc(t)|, that is, when the
absolute size of the prices is unchanged, rc(t) has a zero real part. For positive price series, where the
absolute series is the same as the series itself, the real part has its usual meaning.

The imaginary part shows changes of sign in the price series. When pc(t − 1) > 0 and pc(t) < 0, that
is, when prices move from investments to divestments, rc(t) has a positive imaginary part (+π). When
pc(t − 1) < 0 and pc(t) > 0, that is, when prices move from divestments to investments, rc(t) has a
negative imaginary part (−π). When the sign of the prices is unchanged, rc(t) has a zero imaginary
part. For positive price series, changes of sign are irrelevant, and the imaginary part conveys no
information (0).

Visualization of Complex Returns

Complex continuous returns contain a lot of information. Visualizing the information can help you to
interpret the complex returns. The following code plots the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm
on either side of zero.

p = -5:0.01:5;
hold on
plot(p,real(log(p)),"b")
plot(p,imag(log(p)),"r")
