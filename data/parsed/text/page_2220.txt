Input Arguments

Mu — Drift term of a Brownian motion with drift
numeric

Drift term of a Brownian motion with drift., specified as a scalar numeric.

Data Types: double

Sigma — Diffusion term of a Brownian motion with drift
numeric

Diffusion term of a Brownian motion with drift, specified as a scalar numeric.

Data Types: double

T — A time period of interest
numeric | vector

A time period of interest, specified as a scalar numeric or vector.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

ExpDrawdown — Expected maximum drawdown
numeric

Expected maximum drawdown, returned as a numeric. ExpDrawdown is computed using an
interpolation method. Values are accurate to a fraction of a basis point. Maximum drawdown is
nonnegative since it is the change from a peak to a trough.

Note To compare the actual results from maxdrawdown with the expected results of emaxdrawdown,
set the Format input argument of maxdrawdown to either of the nondefault values ('arithmetic'
or 'geometric'). These are the only two formats that emaxdrawdown supports.
