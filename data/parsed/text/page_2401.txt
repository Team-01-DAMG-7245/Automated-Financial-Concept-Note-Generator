Obtain Group Ratio Constraints for a PortfolioCVaR Object

Suppose you want to ensure that the ratio of financial to nonfinancial companies in your portfolios
never exceeds 50%. Assume you have six assets with three financial companies (assets 1-3) and three
nonfinancial companies (assets 4-6). After setting group ratio constraints, obtain the values for
GroupA, GroupB, LowerRatio, and UpperRatio.

GA = [ true true true false false false ];   % financial companies
GB = [ false false false true true true ];   % nonfinancial companies
p = PortfolioCVaR;
p = setGroupRatio(p, GA, GB, [], 0.5);
[GroupA, GroupB, LowerRatio, UpperRatio] = getGroupRatio(p)

GroupA = 1×6
