•
At the endpoints of the efficient frontier

•
That attain targeted values for return proxies

•
That attain targeted values for risk proxies

•
Along the entire efficient frontier

These functions also provide purchases and sales needed to shift from an initial or current portfolio to
each efficient portfolio. At the efficient frontier level, a collection of functions plot the efficient
frontier and estimate either risk or return proxies for efficient portfolios on the efficient frontier. You
can use the resultant efficient portfolios or risk and return proxies in subsequent analyses.

Arrays of PortfolioMAD Objects

Although all functions associated with a PortfolioMAD object are designed to work on a scalar
PortfolioMAD object, the array capabilities of MATLAB enable you to set up and work with arrays of
PortfolioMAD objects. The easiest way to do this is with the repmat function. For example, to
create a 3-by-2 array of PortfolioMAD objects:

p = repmat(PortfolioMAD, 3, 2);
disp(p)

3×2 PortfolioMAD array with properties:

BuyCost
    SellCost
    RiskFreeRate
    Turnover
    BuyTurnover
    SellTurnover
    NumScenarios
    Name
    NumAssets
    AssetList
    InitPort
    AInequality
    bInequality
    AEquality
    bEquality
    LowerBound
    UpperBound
    LowerBudget
    UpperBudget
    GroupMatrix
    LowerGroup
    UpperGroup
    GroupA
    GroupB
    LowerRatio
    UpperRatio
    MinNumAssets
    MaxNumAssets
    ConditionalBudgetThreshold
    ConditionalUpperBudget
    BoundType

After setting up an array of PortfolioMAD objects, you can work on individual PortfolioMAD
objects in the array by indexing. For example:
