TolParam — Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in model
parameter estimates
1.0e-8 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in model parameter
estimates, specified as a numeric. The convergence test for changes in model parameters is

Paramk −Paramk −1 < TolParam × 1 + Paramk

where Param represents the output Parameters, and iteration k = 2, 3, ... . Convergence is assumed
when both the TolParam and TolObj conditions are satisfied. If both TolParam ≤ 0 and TolObj ≤
0, do the maximum number of iterations (MaxIterations), whatever the results of the convergence
tests.

Data Types: double

TolObj — Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in objective
function
1.0e-12 (default) | numeric

(Optional) Convergence tolerance for estimation algorithm based on changes in the objective
function, specified as a numeric. The convergence test for changes in the objective function is

Ob jk −Ob jk −1 < TolOb j × 1 + Ob jk

for iteration k = 2, 3, ... . Convergence is assumed when both the TolParam and TolObj conditions
are satisfied. If both TolParam ≤ 0 and TolObj ≤ 0, do the maximum number of iterations
(MaxIterations), whatever the results of the convergence tests.

Data Types: double

Param0 — Estimate for the parameters of regression model
[] (default) | vector

(Optional) Estimate for the parameters of the regression model, specified as an NUMPARAMS-by-1
column vector.

Data Types: double

Covar0 — Estimate for the covariance matrix of regression residuals
[] (default) | matrix

(Optional) Estimate for the covariance matrix of the regression residuals, specified as NUMSERIES-by-
NUMSERIES matrix.

Data Types: double

CovarFormat — Format for the covariance matrix
'full' (default) | character vector

(Optional) Format for the covariance matrix, specified as a character vector. The choices are:

•
'full' — Compute the full covariance matrix.

•
'diagonal' — Force the covariance matrix to be a diagonal matrix.

Data Types: char
