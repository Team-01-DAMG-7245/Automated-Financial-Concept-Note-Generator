The Portfolio object can also compute the weights associated with the minimum variance portfolio,
which is defined by the following problem.

min xTΣx

st .
∑
i = 1

n
xi = 1

x ≥0

The minimum variance weights is the benchmark against which all the weights of the diversification
strategies are compared.

wMinVar = estimateFrontierLimits(p,'min');

Portfolio Objects Over Optimization Toolbox” on page 4-132.

Specify Diversification Techniques

This section presents the three diversification methods. Each of the three diversification methods is
associated with a diversification measure and that diversification measure defines a penalty term to
achieve different diversification levels. The diversification, obtained by adding the penalty term to the
objective function, ranges from the behavior achieved by the minimum variance portfolio to the
behavior of the EW, ECR, and MDP, respectively.

The default portfolio has only one equality constraint and a lower bound for the assets weights. The
weights must be nonnegative and they must sum to 1. The feasible set is represented asX:
