Instance Hierarchy

There are inheritance relationships among the SDE classes, as follows.

For more information, see “SDE Models” on page 14-7, “SDE Classes and Associated Simulation
Methods” on page 14-13, and “SDE Class Hierarchy” on page 14-5.

Algorithms

The Bates model (Bates 1996) is an extension of the Heston model and adds not only stochastic
volatility, but also the jump diffusion parameters as in Merton (1976) were also added to model
sudden asset price movements.

Under the risk-neutral measure the model is expressed as follows

dSt = (γ −q −λpμj)Stdt +
υtStdWt + JStdPt

dυt = κ(θ −υt)dt + συ υtdWt
υ

E dWtdWt
υ = pdt

prob(dPt = 1) = λpdt
