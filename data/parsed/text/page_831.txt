Setting Default Constraints Using the setDefaultConstraints Function

An alternative approach is to use the setDefaultConstraints function. If the number of assets is
already known in a PortfolioMAD object, use setDefaultConstraints with no arguments to set
up the necessary bound and budget constraints. Suppose that you have 20 assets to set up the
portfolio set for a default problem:

p = PortfolioMAD('NumAssets', 20);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
disp(p)

If the number of assets is unknown, setDefaultConstraints accepts NumAssets as an optional
argument to form a portfolio set for a default problem. Suppose that you have 20 assets:
