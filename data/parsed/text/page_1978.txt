Input Arguments

CouponRate — Annual percentage rate used to determine coupons payable on a bond
decimal

Annual percentage rate used to determine the coupons payable on a bond, specified as decimal using
a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector.

CouponRate is 0 for zero coupon bonds.

Note CouponRate and Face can change over the life of the bond. Schedules for CouponRate and
Face can be specified with an NBONDS-by-1 cell array, where each element is a NumDates-by-2 matrix
or cell array, where the first column is dates (serial date numbers or character vectors) and the
second column is associated rates. The date indicates the last day that the coupon rate or face value
is valid. This means that the corresponding CouponRate and Face value applies "on or before" the
specified ending date.

Data Types: double | cell | char

Settle — Settlement date of bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date of the bond, specified as a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array,
string array, or date character vectors. The Settle date must be before the Maturity date.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date of bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date of the bond, specified as a scalar or a NBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string
array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, cfamounts also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Example: [CFlowAmounts, CFlowDates, TFactors, CFlowFlags] = ...
