mvnrmle

Multivariate normal regression (ignore missing data)

Syntax

[Parameters,Covariance,Resid,Info] = mvnrmle(Data,Design)
[Parameters,Covariance,Resid,Info] = mvnrmle( ___ ,MaxIterations,TolParam,
TolObj,Covar0,CovarFormat)

Description

[Parameters,Covariance,Resid,Info] = mvnrmle(Data,Design) estimates a multivariate
normal regression model without missing data. The model has the form

Datak ∼N Designk × Parameters, Covariance

for samples k = 1, ... , NUMSAMPLES.

mvnrmle estimates a NUMPARAMS-by-1 column vector of model parameters called Parameters, and a
NUMSERIES-by-NUMSERIES matrix of covariance parameters called Covariance.

mvnrmle(Data, Design) with no output arguments plots the log-likelihood function for each
iteration of the algorithm.

[Parameters,Covariance,Resid,Info] = mvnrmle( ___ ,MaxIterations,TolParam,
TolObj,Covar0,CovarFormat) estimates a multivariate normal regression model without missing
data using optional arguments.

Input Arguments

Data — Data sample
matrix

Data sample, specified as an NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMSERIES matrix with NUMSAMPLES samples of a
NUMSERIES-dimensional random vector. If a data sample has missing values, represented as NaNs,
the sample is ignored. (Use mvnrmle to handle missing data.)

Data Types: double

Design — Model design
matrix | cell array of character vectors

Model design, specified as a matrix or a cell array that handles two model structures:

•
If NUMSERIES = 1, Design is a NUMSAMPLES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix with known values. This
structure is the standard form for regression on a single series.

•
If NUMSERIES ≥ 1, Design is a cell array. The cell array contains either one or NUMSAMPLES cells.
Each cell contains a NUMSERIES-by-NUMPARAMS matrix of known values.

If Design has a single cell, it is assumed to have the same Design matrix for each sample. If
Design has more than one cell, each cell contains a Design matrix for each sample.
