Active Returns and Tracking Error Efficient Frontier

This example shows how to minimize the variance of the difference in returns with respect to a given
target portfolio.

Suppose that you want to identify an efficient set of portfolios that minimize the variance of the
difference in returns with respect to a given target portfolio, subject to a given expected excess
return. The mean and standard deviation of this excess return are often called the active return and
active risk, respectively. Active risk is sometimes referred to as the tracking error. Since the objective
is to track a given target portfolio as closely as possible, the resulting set of portfolios is sometimes
referred to as the tracking error efficient frontier.

Specifically, assume that the target portfolio is expressed as an index weight vector, such that the
index return series may be expressed as a linear combination of the available assets. This example
illustrates how to construct a frontier that minimizes the active risk (tracking error) subject to
attaining a given level of return. That is, it computes the tracking error efficient frontier.

One way to construct the tracking error efficient frontier is to explicitly form the target return series
and subtract it from the return series of the individual assets. In this manner, you specify the
expected mean and covariance of the active returns, and compute the efficient frontier subject to the
usual portfolio constraints.

This example works directly with the mean and covariance of the absolute (unadjusted) returns but
converts the constraints from the usual absolute weight format to active weight format.

Consider a portfolio of five assets with the following expected returns, standard deviations, and
correlation matrix based on absolute weekly asset returns.

NumAssets    =  5;

ExpReturn    = [0.2074  0.1971  0.2669  0.1323  0.2535]/100;

Sigmas       = [2.6570  3.6297  3.9916  2.7145  2.6133]/100;

Correlations = [1.0000  0.6092  0.6321  0.5833  0.7304
                0.6092  1.0000  0.8504  0.8038  0.7176
                0.6321  0.8504  1.0000  0.7723  0.7236
                0.5833  0.8038  0.7723  1.0000  0.7225
                0.7304  0.7176  0.7236  0.7225  1.0000];

Convert the correlations and standard deviations to a covariance matrix using corr2cov.

ExpCovariance = corr2cov(Sigmas, Correlations);

Assume that the target index portfolio is an equally weighted portfolio formed from the five assets.
The sum of index weights equals 1, satisfying the standard full investment budget equality constraint.

Index = ones(NumAssets, 1)/NumAssets;

Generate an asset constraint matrix using portcons. The constraint matrix AbsConSet is expressed
in absolute format (unadjusted for the index), and is formatted as [A b], corresponding to
constraints of the form A*w <= b. Each row of AbsConSet corresponds to a constraint, and each
column corresponds to an asset. Allow no short-selling and full investment in each asset (lower and
upper bounds of each asset are 0 and 1, respectively). In particular, note that the first two rows
