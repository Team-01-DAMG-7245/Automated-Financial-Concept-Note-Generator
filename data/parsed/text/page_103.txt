Machine Learning for Statistical Arbitrage II: Feature
Engineering and Model Development

This example creates a continuous-time Markov model of limit order book (LOB) dynamics, and
develops a strategy for algorithmic trading based on patterns observed in the data. It is part of a
series of related examples on machine learning for statistical arbitrage (see “Machine Learning
Applications”).

Exploratory Data Analysis

To predict the future behavior of a system, you need to discover patterns in historical data. The vast
amount of data available from exchanges, such as NASDAQ, poses computational challenges while
offering statistical opportunities. This example explores LOB data by looking for indicators of price
momentum, following the approach in [4].

Raw Data

Load LOBVars.mat, the preprocessed LOB data set of the NASDAQ security INTC, which is included
with the Financial Toolbox™ documentation.

load LOBVars

The data set contains the following information for each order: the arrival time t (seconds from
midnight), level 1 asking price MOAsk, level 1 bidding price MOBid, midprice S, and imbalance index
I.

Create a plot that shows the intraday evolution of the LOB imbalance index I and midprice S.
