Algorithms

When you specify the required input parameters as arrays, they are associated with a specific
parametric form. By contrast, when you specify either required input parameter as a function, you
can customize virtually any specification.

Accessing the output parameters with no inputs simply returns the original input specification. Thus,
when you invoke these parameters with no inputs, they behave like simple properties and allow you
to test the data type (double vs. function, or equivalently, static vs. dynamic) of the original input
specification. This is useful for validating and designing methods.

When you invoke these parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the impression of
dynamic behavior. The parameters accept the observation time t and a state vector Xt, and return an
array of appropriate dimension. Even if you originally specified an input as an array, sdemrd treats it
as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing that all parameters are accessible
by the same interface.
