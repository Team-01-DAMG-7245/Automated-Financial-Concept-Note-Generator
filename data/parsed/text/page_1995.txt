cfdatesq

Quasi-coupon dates for fixed-income security

Syntax

QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq(Settle,Maturity)
QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate,PeriodsBeforeSettle,PeriodsAfterMaturity)

Description

QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq(Settle,Maturity) returns a matrix of quasi-coupon dates
expressed in datetime format (if any inputs are in datetime format).

Successive quasi-coupon dates determine the length of the standard coupon period for the fixed-
income security of interest, and do not necessarily coincide with actual coupon payment dates. Quasi-
coupon dates are determined regardless of whether the first or last coupon periods are normal, long,
or short.

QuasiCouponDates has NUMBONDS rows and the number of columns is determined by the maximum
number of quasi-coupon dates required to hold the bond portfolio. NaNs are padded for bonds which
have less than the maximum number quasi-coupon dates. By default, quasi-coupon dates after
settlement and on or preceding maturity are returned. If settlement occurs on maturity, and maturity
is a quasi-coupon date, then the maturity date is returned.

QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq( ___ ,Period,Basis,EndMonthRule,IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate,LastCouponDate,PeriodsBeforeSettle,PeriodsAfterMaturity)
specifies options using one or more optional arguments in addition to the input arguments in the
previous syntax.

Examples

Obtain Quasi-Coupon Dates for Fixed-Income Security

Compute the quasi-coupon dates given the Settle and Maturity dates.

QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq('14-Mar-1997', '30-Nov-1998', 2, 0, 1)

QuasiCouponDates = 1Ã—4

729541      729724      729906      730089

If any of the inputs for Settle, Maturity, IssueDate, FirstCouponDate, or LastCouponDate
are datetime arrays, then QuasiCouponDates is returned as a datetime array. For example:

QuasiCouponDates = cfdatesq('14-Mar-1997', datetime('30-Nov-1998','Locale','en_US'), 2, 0, 1)
