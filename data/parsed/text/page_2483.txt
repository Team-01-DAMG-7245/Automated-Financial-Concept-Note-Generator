— Maximum drawdown of an arithmetic Brownian motion with drift (differences of data from peak
to trough) using the equation

dX t = μdt + σdW t .

•
'geometric'

— Maximum drawdown of a geometric Brownian motion with drift (differences of log of data from
peak to trough) using the equation

dS t = μ0S t dt + σ0S t dW t

Data Types: char

Output Arguments

MaxDD — Maximum drawdown
vector

Maximum drawdown, returned as a 1-by-N vector with maximum drawdown for each of N time series.

Note

•
Drawdown is the percentage drop in total returns from the start to the end of a period. If the total
equity time series is increasing over an entire period, drawdown is 0. Otherwise, it is a positive
number. Maximum drawdown is an ex-ante proxy for downside risk that computes the largest
drawdown over all intervals of time that can be formed within a specified interval of time.

•
Maximum drawdown is sensitive to quantization error.

MaxDDIndex — Start and end indexes for each maximum drawdown period for each total
equity time series
vector

Start and end indexes for each maximum drawdown period for each total equity time series, returned
as a 2-by-N vector of start and end indexes. The first row of the vector contains the start indexes and
the second row contains the end indexes of each maximum drawdown period.

More About

Maximum Drawdown

Maximum drawdown (MDD) is a key risk metric to measure the largest peak-to-trough decline in the
value of an investment portfolio, mutual fund, or financial asset over a specified period.

MDD quantifies the potential loss an investor could experience during a downturn, providing insights
into the risk and volatility associated with an investment.
