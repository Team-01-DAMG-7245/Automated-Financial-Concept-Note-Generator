Ultimately, a copula will be used to generate random numbers to drive the simulations. The CDF and
inverse CDF transforms will capture the volatility of simulated returns as part of the diffusion term of
the SDE. The mean return of each index is governed by the riskless rate and incorporated in the drift
term of the SDE. The following code segment centers the returns (that is, extracts the mean) of each
index.

Because the following analysis uses extreme value theory to characterize the distribution of each
equity index return series, it is helpful to examine details for a particular country:

returns = tick2ret(prices,'Method','continuous');  % Convert prices to returns
returns = returns - mean(returns);  % Center the returns
index   = 3;                        % Germany stored in column 3

plot(dates(2:end), returns(:,index))
xlabel('Date')
ylabel('Return')
title(['Daily Logarithmic Centered Returns: ' series{index}])

Note that this code segment can be changed to examine details for any country.

Using these centered returns, estimate the empirical, or non-parametric, CDF of each index with a
Gaussian kernel. This smoothes the CDF estimates, eliminating the staircase pattern of unsmoothed
sample CDFs. Although non-parametric kernel CDF estimates are well-suited for the interior of the
distribution, where most of the data is found, they tend to perform poorly when applied to the upper
and lower tails. To better estimate the tails of the distribution, apply EVT to the returns that fall in
each tail.
