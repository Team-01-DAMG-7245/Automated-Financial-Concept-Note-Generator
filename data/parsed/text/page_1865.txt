Price a Treasury Bond from Yield to Maturity Using datetime Inputs

This example shows how to use datetime inputs to price a treasury bond at three different yield
values.

Yield = [0.04; 0.05; 0.06];
CouponRate = 0.05;
Settle = datetime('20-Jan-1997','Locale','en_US');
Maturity = datetime('15-Jun-2002','Locale','en_US');
Period = 2;
Basis = 0;
[Price, AccruedInt] = bndprice(Yield, CouponRate, Settle,...
Maturity, Period, Basis)

Price = 3×1

104.8106
   99.9951
   95.4384

AccruedInt = 3×1

0.4945
    0.4945
    0.4945

Price a Treasury Bond with Different Yield Values

This example shows how to price a Treasury bond at two different yield values that include

'LastCouponInterest','simple')

ans = 
103.4743
