More About

Credit Default Swap

A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial derivative contract that allows an investor to "swap" or
transfer the credit risk of a borrower (usually a corporation or government) to another party.

The parties involved are:

•
Protection Buyer — The party that purchases the CDS to protect against the risk of default. They
pay periodic premiums (known as the CDS spread) to the protection seller.

•
Protection Seller — The party that provides the credit protection and receives the premiums
from the protection buyer. In the event of a default, the protection seller is obligated to
compensate the protection buyer.

RPV01

RPV01, associated with a CDS, is the value of a stream of 1-basis-point premiums according to the
payment structure of the CDS contract, and considering the default probability over time.

For more information, see [3] and [4] for details.

Version History
Introduced in R2013b

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cdsrpv01 supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
