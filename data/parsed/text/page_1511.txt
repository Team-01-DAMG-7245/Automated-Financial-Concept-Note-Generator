JumpVol — Instantaneous standard deviation
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous standard deviation of log(1+J), specified as an array, a deterministic function of time,
or a deterministic function of time and state.

If you specify JumpVol as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NJumps matrix.

If you specify JumpVol as a deterministic function of time, when you call JumpVol with a real-valued
scalar time t as its only input, it must return an NVars-by-NJumps matrix.

If you specify JumpVol as a deterministic function of time and state, it must return an NVars-by-
NJumps matrix when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt

Data Types: double | function_handle

Output Arguments

Merton — Merton model
Merton object

Merton model, returned as a Merton object.

Properties

StartTime — Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables
0 (default) | scalar

Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables, specified as a scalar.

Data Types: double

StartState — Initial values of state variables
1 (default) | scalar | column vector | matrix

Initial values of state variables, specified as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

If StartState is a scalar, merton applies the same initial value to all state variables on all trials.

If StartState is a column vector, merton applies a unique initial value to each state variable on all
trials.

If StartState is a matrix, merton applies a unique initial value to each state variable on each trial.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
NBrowns-by-NBrowns identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) |
positive semidefinite matrix | deterministic function

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as an NBrowns-by-NBrowns positive semidefinite matrix, or as a

merton
