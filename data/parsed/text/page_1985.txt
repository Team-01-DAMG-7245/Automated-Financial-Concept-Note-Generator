Cash Flow Type

8
Smaller than normal maturity cash flow when the bond has less than one coupon
period to maturity.

9
Larger than normal maturity cash flow when the bond has less than one coupon
period to maturity.

10
Maturity cash flow on a zero coupon bond.

11
Sinking principal and initial cash flow amount smaller than normal due to a
"stub" coupon period. A stub period is created when the time from issue date to
first coupon date is shorter than normal.

12
Sinking principal and larger than normal initial cash flow amount because the
first coupon period is longer than normal.

13
Sinking principal and nominal coupon cash flow amount.

CFPrincipal — Principal cash flows
matrix

Principal cash flows, returned as a NBONDS-by-NCFS matrix.

If PrincipalType is 'sinking', CFPrincipal output indicates when the principal is returned.

If PrincipalType is 'bullet', CFPrincipal is all zeros and, at Maturity, the appropriate Face
value.

Time Factors

Time factors help determine the present value of a stream of cash flows.

The term time factors refer to the exponent TF in the discounting equation

PV = ∑
i = 1

n
CF

(1 + z
f )
TF ,

where:

PV =
Present value of a cash flow.

CF =
Cash flow amount.

z =
Risk-adjusted annualized rate or yield corresponding to a given cash flow. The
yield is quoted on a semiannual basis.

f =
Frequency of quotes for the yield. Default is 2 for Basis values 0 to 7 and 13
and 1 for Basis values 8 to 12. The default can be overridden by specifying the
CompoundingFrequency name-value pair.
