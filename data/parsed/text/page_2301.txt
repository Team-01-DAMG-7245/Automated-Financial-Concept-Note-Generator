TolX — Tolerance on the step size for fminbnd convergence when using 'iterative'
method
1e-8 (default) | positive scalar

Tolerance on the step size for fminbnd convergence when using 'iterative' method, specified as
the comma-separated pair consisting of 'TolX' and a positive scalar. The step size is related to the
return levels achieved on the efficient frontier and tried by fminbnd. If the specified TolX is large
compared to the range of returns, the accuracy of the solution is poor. TolX should be a number
smaller than 0.01*(maxReturn - minReturn).

Note If the 'direct' method is selected, TolX is ignored.

Data Types: double

Output Arguments

pwgt — Portfolio on efficient frontier with maximum Sharpe ratio
vector

Portfolio on the efficient frontier with a maximum Sharpe ratio, returned as a NumAssets vector.

pbuy — Purchases relative to initial portfolio for portfolio on efficient frontier with
maximum Sharpe ratio
vector

Purchases relative to an initial portfolio for a portfolio on the efficient frontier with a maximum
Sharpe ratio, returned as a NumAssets vector.

pbuy is returned for a Portfolio input object (obj).

psell — Sales relative to initial portfolio for portfolio on efficient frontier with maximum
Sharpe ratio
vector

Sales relative to an initial portfolio for a portfolio on the efficient frontier with maximum Sharpe ratio,
returned as a NumAssets vector.

psell is returned for a Portfolio input object (obj).

More About

Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe ratio is the ratio of the difference between the mean of portfolio returns and the risk-free
rate divided by the standard deviation of portfolio returns.

The estimateMaxSharpeRatio function maximizes the Sharpe ratio among portfolios on the
efficient frontier.

Tips

You can also use dot notation to estimate an efficient portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.
