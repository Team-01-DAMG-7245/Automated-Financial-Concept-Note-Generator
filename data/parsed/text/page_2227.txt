Using ObjectiveBound

Use the ObjectiveBound name-value argument to provide an initial bound for the objective
function. Providing an initial bound saves computation time because the solver does not have to solve
an initial NLP relaxation to obtain the initial bound. Set up the MINLP solver, then test its
performance when you do not provide an initial bound.

% Minimize tracking error without a lower bound
wTE = 1/p.NumAssets*ones(p.NumAssets,1);
trackingError = @(w) (w-wTE)'*p.AssetCovar*(w-wTE);
pInt2 = setSolverMINLP(pInt,'OuterApproximation',...
    ExtendedFormulation=true);
s = tic;
wTE_NoBound = estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio(pInt2,trackingError);
timeTE_NoBound = toc(s)

timeTE_NoBound = 
8.6102

Since the lowest value that can be achieved by the tracking error is 0, you can use that as the lower
bound with the ObjectiveBound name-value argument. Test the solver's performance when you do
provide this lower bound. The solver is much faster when you provide one.

% Minimize tracking error with a lower bound
s = tic;
wTE_WithBound = estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio(pInt2,trackingError,ObjectiveBound=0);
timeTE_WithBound = toc(s)

timeTE_WithBound = 
2.0617

Because you are minimizing the objective function, the bound that you provide to
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio must be a lower bound.

If you want to maximize the objective, then when you set ObjectiveSense to 'maximize', the
ObjectiveBound is the upper bound of the objective function. Maximize the Sharpe ratio using
ObjectiveBound.

% Maximize Sharpe ratio with upper bound
sharpeRatio = @(x) (p.AssetMean'*x)/sqrt(x'*p.AssetCovar*x);
wSR = estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio(pInt,sharpeRatio,...
    ObjectiveSense='maximize',ObjectiveBound=1);

Note that the ObjectiveBound name-value argument is ignored in continuous problems.

Using InitialPoint

Use the InitialPoint name-value argument to provide an initial point to the Portfolio solvers at
the beginning of the iterations. You can use this name-value argument in continuous problems with
nonconvex objectives to search the feasible region to find different local minima.

Set up a risk parity portfolio with constraints, group the constraints, then estimate the portfolio
without and with specifying an initial point. Compare the risk parities of these portfolios.

% Risk parity portfolio with constraints
sigma = [5;5;7;10;15;15;15;18]/100;
rho = [ 1    0.8  0.6 -0.2 -0.1 -0.2 -0.2 -0.2;
