List of all dates that have any cash flow from the bond portfolio, returned as an NUMDATES-by-1
matrix. The AllDates matrix is expressed in datetime format (if CFlowDates is in datetime format).

AllTF — Time factors corresponding to the dates in AllDates
matrix

Time factors corresponding to the dates in AllDates, returned as an NUMDATES-by-1 matrix. If
TFactors is not entered, AllTF contains the number of days from the first date in AllDates.

IndByBond — Indices by bond
matrix

Indices by bond, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-NUMCFS matrix. The ith row contains a list of indices
into AllDates where the ith bond has cash flows. Since some bonds have more cash flows than
others, the matrix is padded with NaNs.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cfport supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
