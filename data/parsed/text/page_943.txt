the function which ratings are to be grouped together (1 to 4, and 5 to 7). You can also group all non-
default ratings into one category. These are preliminary steps to get the IG, SG, and overall default
rates for each year.

edgesIGSG = [4 7];
totalsIGSG = transprobgrouptotals(totalsByRtg,edgesIGSG);
edgesAll = 7; % Could also use edgesAll = 2 with totalsIGSG
totalsAll = transprobgrouptotals(totalsByRtg,edgesAll);

Here are the 2005 totals grouped at IG/SG level, and the corresponding transition matrix, recovered
using transprobbytotals.

fprintf('\nTransition counts for 2005 at IG/SG level:\n\n')

Transition counts for 2005 at IG/SG level:

Example_DisplayTransitions(totalsIGSG(end).totalsMat, ...
   totalsIGSG(end).totalsVec, ...
   {'IG','SG'}, ...
   {'IG','SG','D','NR'})

Init     IG     SG      D     NR 
    IG   3264   3035     54      1    174 
    SG   2151     66   1780     29    276

fprintf('\nTransition matrix for 2005 at IG/SG level:\n\n')

Transition matrix for 2005 at IG/SG level:

Example_DisplayTransitions(transprobbytotals(totalsIGSG(end)),[], ...
   {'IG','SG'},...
   {'IG','SG','D','NR'})

IG     SG      D     NR 
    IG  92.98   1.65   0.03   5.33 
    SG   3.07  82.75   1.35  12.83

Now get transition matrices for every year both at IG/SG and non-default/default levels and store the
default rates only (this example does not use the rest of the transition probabilities).

DefRateIG = zeros(nYears,1);
DefRateSG = zeros(nYears,1);
DefRate = zeros(nYears,1);
for t=1:nYears
   % Get transition matrix at IG/SG level and extract IG default rate and
   % SG default rate for year t
   tmIGSG = transprobbytotals(totalsIGSG(t));
   DefRateIG(t) = tmIGSG(1,3);
   DefRateSG(t) = tmIGSG(2,3);
   % Get transition matrix at most aggregate level and extract overall
   % corporate default rate for year t
   tmAll = transprobbytotals(totalsAll(t));
   DefRate(t) = tmAll(1,2);
end

Here is a visualization of the dynamics of IG, SG, and overall corporate default rates together. To
emphasize their patterns, rather than their magnitudes, a log scale is used. The shaded bands
indicate recession years. The patterns of SG and IG are slightly different. For example, the IG rate is
