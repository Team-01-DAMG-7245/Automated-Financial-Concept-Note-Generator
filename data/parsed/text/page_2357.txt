Calculate adjustedsimple margin.

[Margin, AdjPrice] = floatmargin(Price, Spread, Settle, Maturity, ...
'SpreadType', 'adjustedsimple', 'RateInfo', [StubRate, SpotRate], ...
'LatestFloatingRate', LatestFloatingRate, 'Reset', Reset, 'Basis', Basis)

Calculate adjustedtotal margin.

[Margin, AdjPrice] = floatmargin(Price, Spread, Settle, Maturity, ...
'SpreadType', 'adjustedtotal', 'RateInfo', [StubRate, SpotRate], ...
'LatestFloatingRate', LatestFloatingRate, 'Reset', Reset, 'Basis', Basis)

Input Arguments

Price — Bond prices where spreads are to be computed
matrix

Bond prices where spreads are to be computed, specified as a NINST-by-1 matrix.

Data Types: double

Spread — Number of basis points over the reference rate
numeric

Number of basis points over the reference rate, specified as a NINST-by-1 matrix.

Data Types: double

Settle — Settlement date of the floating-rate bonds
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date of the floating-rate bonds, specified as a scalar or a NINST-by-1 vector using a
datetime array, string array, or date character vectors. If supplied as a NINST-by-1 vector of dates, all
settlement dates must be the same (only a single settlement date is supported)

To support existing code, floatmargin also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date of the floating-rate bond
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date of the floating-rate bond, specified as a NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime array,
string array, or date character vectors.
