The RSI signal takes a value of 1 (indicating a buy signal) when the RSI value for the stock falls below
30. The signal takes a value of -1 (indicating a sell signal) when the RSI for the stock rises above 70.
Otherwise, the signal takes a value of 0, indicating no action.

Build the Strategies

Build the strategies for the backtestStrategy object using the rebalance functions defined in the
Local Functions on page 4-261 section. Each strategy uses the rebalance function to make trading
decisions based on the appropriate signals.

The signals require sufficient trailing data to compute the trading signals (for example, computing
the SMA20 for day X requires prices from the 20 days prior to day X). All of the trailing data is
captured in the precomputed trading signals. So the actual strategies need only a 2-day lookback
window to make trading decisions to evaluate when the signals cross trading thresholds.

All strategies pay 25 basis points transaction costs on buys and sells.

The initial weights are computed based on the signal values after 20 trading days. The backtest
begins after this 20 day initialization period.
