Step 7. Analyzing descriptive properties of the Portfolio structures.

To be more concrete about the ranges of efficient portfolio returns and risks, use the
estimateFrontierLimits function to obtain portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier.
Given these portfolios, compute their moments using the estimatePortMoments function. The
following code generates a table that lists the risk and return of the initial portfolio as well as the
gross and net moments of portfolio returns for the portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier:

[prsk0, pret0] = estimatePortMoments(p, p.InitPort);

pret = estimatePortReturn(p, p.estimateFrontierLimits);
qret = estimatePortReturn(q, q.estimateFrontierLimits);

displayReturns(pret0, pret, qret)

Annualized Portfolio Returns ...
                                    Gross       Net
Initial Portfolio Return             9.70 %    9.70 %
Minimum Efficient Portfolio Return   5.90 %    5.77 %
Maximum Efficient Portfolio Return  13.05 %   12.86 %

The results show that the cost to trade ranges from 14 to 19 basis points to get from the current
portfolio to the efficient portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier (these costs are the
difference between gross and net portfolio returns.) In addition, notice that the maximum efficient
portfolio return (13%) is less than the maximum asset return (18%) due to the constraints on equity
allocations.

Step 8. Obtaining a Portfolio at the specified return level on the efficient frontier.

A common approach to select efficient portfolios is to pick a portfolio that has a desired fraction of
the range of expected portfolio returns. To obtain the portfolio that is 30% of the range from the
minimum to maximum return on the efficient frontier, obtain the range of net returns in qret using
the Portfolio object q and interpolate to obtain a 30% level with the interp1 function to obtain a
portfolio qwgt.

Level = 0.3;

qret = estimatePortReturn(q, q.estimateFrontierLimits);
qwgt = estimateFrontierByReturn(q, interp1([0, 1], qret, Level));
[qrsk, qret] = estimatePortMoments(q, qwgt);

displayReturnLevel(Level, qret, qrsk);
