Input Arguments

Settle — Settlement date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Settlement date, specified as a scalar, or an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, or string
array, or date character vectors. Settle must be earlier than Maturity.

To support existing code, accrfrac also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Maturity — Maturity date
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity date, specified as a scalar, or an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector using a datetime array, or string
array, or date character vectors.

To support existing code, accrfrac also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Period — Coupons per year of the bond
2 (semiannual) (default) | vector of positive integers from the set [1,2,3,4,6,12]

Coupons per year of the bond, specified as a scalar or an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of positive integers
from the set [1,2,3,4,6,12].

Data Types: single | double

Basis — Day-count basis of the instrument
0 (actual/actual) (default) | numeric with value 0 through 13 | vector of numerics with values 0
through 13

Day-count basis of the instrument, specified as a scalar integer with a value of 0 through 13 or a
NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of integers with values of 0 through 13.
