(Optional) Indicator which portfolios to obtain at the extreme ends of the efficient frontier, specified
as a character vector with values 'Both' or "Both", 'Min' or "Min", or 'Max' or "Max". The
options for a Choice action are:

•
[] — Compute both minimum-risk and maximum-return portfolios.

•
'Both' or "Both" — Compute both minimum-risk and maximum-return portfolios.

•
'Min' or "Min" — Compute minimum-risk portfolio only.

•
'Max' or "Max" — Compute maximum-return portfolio only.

Data Types: char | string

Output Arguments

pwgt — Optimal portfolios at endpoints of efficient frontier
matrix

Optimal portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier TargetReturn, returned as a
NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix. pwgt is returned for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

pbuy — Purchases relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios at endpoints of
efficient frontier
matrix

Purchases relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier,
returned as NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix.

Note If no initial portfolio is specified in obj.InitPort, that value is assumed to be 0 such that
pbuy = max(0, pwgt) and psell = max(0, -pwgt).

pbuy is returned for a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD input object (obj).

psell — Sales relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios at endpoints of efficient
frontier
matrix

Sales relative to an initial portfolio for optimal portfolios on the efficient frontier, returned as a
NumAssets-by-NumPorts matrix.

Note If no initial portfolio is specified in obj.InitPort, that value is assumed to be 0 such that
pbuy = max(0, pwgt) and psell = max(0, -pwgt).

psell is returned for Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD input object (obj).
