−1 — Continuous compounding

Note  When ZeroData is an IRDataCurve object, the arguments ZeroCompounding and
ZeroBasis are implicit in ZeroData and are redundant inside this function. In that case, specify
these optional arguments when constructing the IRDataCurve object before calling this function.

Data Types: double

ZeroBasis — Basis of zero curve
0 (actual/actual) (default) | positive integers of the set [1...13] | vector of positive integers of the
set [1...13]

Basis of the zero curve, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ZeroBasis' and a
positive integer using a NINST-by-1 vector.

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252
