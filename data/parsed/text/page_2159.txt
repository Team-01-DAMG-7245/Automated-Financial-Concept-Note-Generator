Execute the function disc2zero which returns the zero curve ZeroRates at the maturity dates
CurveDates.

[ZeroRates, CurveDates] = disc2zero(DiscRates, CurveDates, Settle, Compounding, Basis)

For readability, DiscRates and ZeroRates are shown here only to the basis point. However,
MATLAB® software computed them at full precision. If you enter DiscRates as shown, ZeroRates
may differ due to rounding.

Input Arguments

DiscRates — Discount factors
decimal fraction

Discount factors, specified as a NDATES-by-1 column vector of decimal fractions. In aggregate, the
factors in DiscRates constitute a discount curve for the investment horizon represented by
CurveDates.

Data Types: double

CurveDates — Maturity dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Maturity dates that correspond to the discount factors in DiscRates, specified as a NDATES-by-1
column vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors.
