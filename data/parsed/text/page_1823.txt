Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Note Any optional input of size N-by-1 is also acceptable as an array of size 1-by-N, or as a single
value applicable to all contracts.

Example: [ProbabilityData,HazardData] =
bondDefaultBootstrap(ZeroData,MarketData,Settle,'RecoveryRate',Recovery,'Zero
Compounding',-1)

RecoveryRate — Recovery rate
0.4 (default) | decimal

Recovery rate, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RecoveryRate' and a N-by-1
vector of recovery rates, expressed as a decimal from 0 through 1.

Data Types: double

ProbabilityDates — Dates for output of default probability data
column of dates in MarketData (default) | datetime array | string array | date character vector

Dates for the output of default probability data, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'ProbabilityDates' and a P-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors.

To support existing code, bondDefaultBootstrap also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but
they are not recommended.

Data Types: char | datetime | string

ZeroCompounding — Compounding frequency of the zero curve
2 (semiannual) (default) | integer with value of 1,2,3,4,6,12, or –1

Compounding frequency of the zero curve, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'ZeroCompounding' and a N-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
1 — Annual compounding

•
2 — Semiannual compounding

•
3 — Compounding three times per year

•
4 — Quarterly compounding

•
6 — Bimonthly compounding

•
12 — Monthly compounding

•
−1 — Continuous compounding
