In R2023a, financial time series (fints), and its associated methods have been removed and are
replaced with a MATLAB timetable function. If you use fints or the associated methods, you
receive an error. To help you convert from the older fints to the newer timetable functionality, use
the following information.

Construct by passing in
data and dates

fints(dates,data,datanames
)

Use timetable:

timetable(rowTimes,var1,...,
varN,'VariableNames',
{'a','b',...})

Construct by conversion of
files

ascii2fts(filename,descrow
,colheadrow,skiprows)

Use readtable and
table2timetable:

T =
readtable(filename,opts,Name
,Value)

TT =
table2timetable(T,'RowTimes'
,timeVarName)

Write files
fts2ascii(filename,tsobj,e
xttext)

Use writetable:

writetable(TT,filename)

Convert to matrix
fts2mat(tsobj)
S = vartype('numeric');

TT2 = TT(:,S)

TT2.Variables
