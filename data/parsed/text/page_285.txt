The problem is
formulated by
introducing
NumAssets binary
variables to
indicate whether
the corresponding
asset is invested or
not. Therefore, it
requires a mixed
integer nonlinear
programming
solver. Three types
of MINLP solvers
are offered, see
setSolverMINLP.

Mixed integer
nonlinear
programming
solver (MINLP)
using
setSolverMINLP

'quadprog' or
'fmincon' are
used when the
estimate
functions reduce
the problem into
NLP. These two
solvers can be
configured through
setSolver.
