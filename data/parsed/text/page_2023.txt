Compute the spread.

Price = 98;
CFAmounts = [30;40;30];
CFDates = [datetime(2004,7,15); datetime(2005,7,15) ; datetime(2006,7,15)];

Spread = cfspread(RateSpec, Price, CFAmounts, CFDates, Settle)

Spread = 3×1
103 ×

-8.7956
   -4.0774
   -3.7073

Input Arguments

RateSpec — Interest-rate specification for initial risk-free rate curve
structure

Interest-rate specification for initial risk-free rate curve, specified by the RateSpec obtained from
intenvset. For information on the interest-rate specification, see intenvset.

Data Types: struct

Price — Price of cash flows
vector

Price of cash flows, specified as an NINST-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

CFlowAmounts — Cash flow amounts
vector

Cash flow amounts, specified as an NINST-by-MOSTCFS matrix. Each row is a list of cash flow values
for one instrument. If an instrument has fewer than MOSTCFS cash flows, the end of the row is padded
with NaNs.

Data Types: double

CFlowDates — Cash flow dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Cash flow dates, specified as an NINST-by-MOSTCFS matrix using a datetime array, string array, or
date character vectors. Each entry contains the date of the corresponding cash flow in
CFlowAmounts.

To support existing code, cfspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Settle — Settlement date
datetime array | string array | date character vector
