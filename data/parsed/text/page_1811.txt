blstheta

Black-Scholes sensitivity to time-until-maturity change

Syntax

[CallTheta,PutTheta] = blstheta(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
[CallTheta,PutTheta] = blstheta( ___ ,Yield)

Description

[CallTheta,PutTheta] = blstheta(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns the
call option theta CallTheta, and the put option theta PutTheta.

Theta is the sensitivity in option value with respect to time and is measured in years. CallTheta or
PutTheta can be divided by 365 to get Theta per calendar day or by 252 to get Theta by trading day.

blstheta uses normcdf, the normal cumulative distribution function, and normpdf, the normal
probability density function, in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and theta values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blstheta can handle other types of underlies like Futures and Currencies. When pricing
Futures (Black model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = Rate

When pricing currencies (Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

[CallTheta,PutTheta] = blstheta( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Compute the Black-Scholes Sensitivity to Time-Until-Maturity Change (Theta)

This example shows how to compute theta, the sensitivity in option value with respect to time.

[CallTheta, PutTheta] = blstheta(50, 50, 0.12, 0.25, 0.3, 0)

CallTheta = 
-8.9630
