Working with Conditional Budget Constraints Using
PortfolioMAD Object

The conditional budget constraint supports the Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities (UCITS) directive for PortfolioMAD objects. The UCITS asset allocation
regulation states that funds can only invest up to 10% in a single issuer, and that investments in
excess of 5% must not exceed 40% of the total portfolio. This is known as the 5/10/40 rule. For more
information, see “Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities” on page 15-1452
and “Adding Constraints to Satisfy UCITS Directive” on page 4-457.

Setting Conditional Budget Constraints Using the PortfolioMAD
Function

The properties for the conditional budget constraint can also be set using the PortfolioMAD object.
Suppose that you have an asset universe with many risky assets and a riskless asset and you want to
ensure that your portfolio never holds more than 1% cash, that is, you want to ensure that you are
99–100% invested in risky assets. The conditional budget constraint for this portfolio can be set with:

p = PortfolioMAD('ConditionalBudgetThreshold', 0.99, 'ConditionalUpperBudget', 1);
disp(p.ConditionalBudgetThreshold)
disp(p.ConditionalUpperBudget)

0.9900

Setting Conditional Budget Constraints Using the
setConditionalBudget Function

You can also set the properties for a conditional budget constraint using setConditionalBudget.
Suppose that you have a fund that permits up to 10% leverage which means that your portfolio can be
from 100% to 110% invested in risky assets. Given a PortfolioMAD object p, use
setConditionalBudget to set the conditional budget constraints:

p = PortfolioMAD;
p = setConditionBudget(p, .40, 1.5);
disp(p.threshold)
disp(p.upperBudget)

.40
