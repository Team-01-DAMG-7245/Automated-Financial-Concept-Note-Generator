Data Types: double

Reset — Frequency of payments per year
1 (default) | numeric

Frequency of payments per year, specified as NINST-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

Basis — Day-count basis used for time factor calculations
0 (actual/actual) (default) | integers of the set [0...13] | vector of integers of the set [0...13]

Day-count basis used for time factor calculations, specified as a NINST-by-1 vector. Values are:

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252

Data Types: double

Principal — Notional principal amounts
100 (default) | numeric

Notional principal amounts, specified as NINST-by-1 vector.

Data Types: double

EndMonthRule — End-of-month rule flag
1 (in effect) (default) | nonnegative integer 0 or 1

End-of-month rule flag, specified as a NINST-by-1 vector. This rule applies only when Maturity is an
end-of-month date for a month having 30 or fewer days.

•
0 = Ignore rule, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the same numerical day of
the month.

•
1 = Set rule on, meaning that a bond coupon payment date is always the last actual day of the
month.
