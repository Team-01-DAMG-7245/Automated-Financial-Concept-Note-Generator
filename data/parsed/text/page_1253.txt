Although the terminal value of the Brownian motion shown in the latter plot is normally distributed,
and the terminal price in the previous plot is lognormally distributed, the corresponding paths of each
graph are similar. For another example of variance reduction techniques, see “Simulate Interest
Rates Through Interpolation” on page 14-50.
