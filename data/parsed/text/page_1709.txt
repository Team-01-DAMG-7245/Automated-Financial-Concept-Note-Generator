simulate

Simulate multivariate stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for SDE, BM, GBM, CEV, CIR, HWV,
Heston, SDEDDO, SDELD, SDEMRD, Merton, or Bates models

Syntax

[Paths,Times,Z] = simulate(MDL)
[Paths,Times,Z] = simulate( ___ ,Optional,Scheme)

Description

[Paths,Times,Z] = simulate(MDL) simulates NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state
variables, driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk over NPeriods consecutive
observation periods, approximating continuous-time stochastic processes.

[Paths,Times,Z] = simulate( ___ ,Optional,Scheme) adds optional inputs for Optional
and Scheme.

The Optional input argument for simulate accepts any variable-length list of input arguments that
the simulation method or function referenced by the SDE.Simulation parameter requires or
accepts. It passes this input list directly to the appropriate SDE simulation method or user-defined
simulation function.

The optional input Scheme lets you specify an approximation scheme used to simulate the sample
paths and you can use this optional input with or without an Optional input argument.

Examples

Antithetic Sampling to a Path-Dependent Barrier Option

Consider a European up-and-in call option on a single underlying stock. The evolution of this stock's
price is governed by a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model with constant parameters:

Assume the following characteristics:

•
The stock currently trades at 105.

•
The stock pays no dividends.

•
The stock volatility is 30% per annum.

•
The option strike price is 100.

•
The option expires in three months.

•
The option barrier is 120.

•
The risk-free rate is constant at 5% per annum.
