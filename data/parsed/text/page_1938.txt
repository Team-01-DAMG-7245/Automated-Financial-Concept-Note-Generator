Z(τi)(Q(τi −1) −Q(τi))

where the integral is approximated with a finite sum over the discretization τ0 = 0,τ1,...,τM = T.

If the spread of an existing CDS contract is SC, and the current breakeven spread for a comparable
contract is S0, the current price, or mark-to-market value of the contract is given by:

MtM = Notional (S0 –SC)RPV01

This assumes a long position from the protection standpoint (protection was bought). For short
positions, the sign is reversed.

Version History
Introduced in R2010b

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although cdsprice supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
