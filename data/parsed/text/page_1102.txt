Calculate True New Portfolio Price

Calculate the true new portfolio price by shifting the yield curve.

[CleanPrice, AccruedInterest] = bndprice(Yields + dY, ...
CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, 2, 0, [], [], [], [], [], ...
Face);

NewPrice = PortfolioAmounts' * (CleanPrice + AccruedInterest)

NewPrice = 
9.7968e+04

Compare Results

Compare the results. The analysis results are as follows:

•
The original portfolio price was $100,000.

•
The yield curve shifted up by 0.2 percentage point or 20 basis points.

•
The portfolio duration and convexity are 10.3181 and 157.6346, respectively. These are needed
for “Bond Portfolio for Hedging Duration and Convexity” on page 10-6.

•
The first-order approximation, based on modified duration, predicts the new portfolio price
(PriceApprox1), which is $97,936.37.

•
The second-order approximation, based on duration and convexity, predicts the new portfolio price
(PriceApprox2), which is $97,968.90.

•
The true new portfolio price (NewPrice) for this yield curve shift is $97,968.51.

•
The estimate using duration and convexity is good (at least for this fairly small shift in the yield
curve), but only slightly better than the estimate using duration alone. The importance of
convexity increases as the magnitude of the yield curve shift increases. Try a larger shift (dY) to
see this effect.

The approximation formulas in this example consider only parallel shifts in the term structure,
because both formulas are functions of dY, the change in yield. The formulas are not well-defined
unless each yield changes by the same amount. In actual financial markets, changes in yield curve
level typically explain a substantial portion of bond price movements. However, other changes in the
yield curve, such as slope, may also be important and are not captured here. Also, both formulas give
local approximations whose accuracy deteriorates as dY increases in size. You can demonstrate this
by running the program with larger values of dY.
