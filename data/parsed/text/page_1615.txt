Simulate Bates sample paths by Euler approximation

Syntax

[Paths,Times,Z,N] = simByEuler(MDL,NPeriods)
[Paths,Times,Z,N] = simByEuler( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[Paths,Times,Z,N] = simByEuler(MDL,NPeriods) simulates NTrials sample paths of Bates
bivariate models driven by NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk and NJumps compound Poisson
processes representing the arrivals of important events over NPeriods consecutive observation
periods. The simulation approximates continuous-time stochastic processes by the Euler approach.

[Paths,Times,Z,N] = simByEuler( ___ ,Name,Value) specifies options using one or more
name-value pair arguments in addition to the input arguments in the previous syntax.

You can perform quasi-Monte Carlo simulations using the name-value arguments for
MonteCarloMethod, QuasiSequence, and BrownianMotionMethod. For more information, see
“Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation” on page 14-63.

Examples

Simulate Bates Sample Paths by Euler Approximation

Create a bates object.

AssetPrice = 80;
            Return = 0.03;
            JumpMean = 0.02;
            JumpVol = 0.08;
            JumpFreq = 0.1;
            
            V0 = 0.04;
            Level = 0.05;
            Speed = 1.0;
            Volatility = 0.2;
            Rho = -0.7;
            StartState = [AssetPrice;V0]; 
            Correlation = [1 Rho;Rho 1];

batesObj = bates(Return, Speed, Level, Volatility,...
                JumpFreq, JumpMean, JumpVol,'startstate',StartState,...
                'correlation',Correlation)

batesObj =
