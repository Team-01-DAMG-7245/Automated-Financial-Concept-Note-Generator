Efficient Portfolio That Maximizes Sharpe Ratio

Portfolios that maximize the Sharpe ratio are portfolios on the efficient frontier that satisfy several
theoretical conditions in finance. Such portfolios are called tangency portfolios since the tangent line
from the risk-free rate to the efficient frontier taps the efficient frontier at portfolios that maximize
the Sharpe ratio.

The Sharpe ratio is defined as the ratio

where x ∈Rnand r0is the risk-free rate (μ and Σ proxies for the portfolio return and risk). For more
information, see “Portfolio Optimization Theory” on page 4-4.

To obtain efficient portfolios that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, the estimateMaxSharpeRatio
function accepts a Portfolio object and obtains efficient portfolios that maximize the Sharpe Ratio.
Suppose that you have a universe with four risky assets and a riskless asset and you want to obtain a
portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, where, in this example, r0 is the return for the riskless
asset.

r0 = 0.03;
m = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18 ];
C = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0;
      0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
      0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
      0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225 ];
 
p = Portfolio('RiskFreeRate', r0);
p = setAssetMoments(p, m, C);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
pwgt = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p);

If you start with an initial portfolio, estimateMaxSharpeRatio also returns purchases and sales to
get from your initial portfolio to the portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. For example, given an
initial portfolio in pwgt0, you can obtain purchases and sales:

pwgt0 = [ 0.3; 0.3; 0.2; 0.1 ];
p = setInitPort(p, pwgt0);
[pwgt, pbuy, psell] = estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p);
