Output Arguments

SDEDDO — SDEDDO model
SDEDDO object

SDEDDO model, returned as a SDEDDO object.

Properties

StartTime — Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables
0 (default) | scalar

Starting time of first observation, applied to all state variables, specified as a scalar

Data Types: double

StartState — Initial values of state variables
1 (default) | scalar, column vector, or matrix

Initial values of state variables, specified as a scalar, column vector, or matrix.

If StartState is a scalar, sdeddo applies the same initial value to all state variables on all trials.

If StartState is a column vector, sdeddo applies a unique initial value to each state variable on all
trials.

If StartState is a matrix, sdeddo applies a unique initial value to each state variable on each trial.

Data Types: double

Correlation — Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the
Brownian motion vector (Wiener processes)
NBrowns-by-NBrowns identity matrix representing independent Gaussian processes (default) |
positive semidefinite matrix | deterministic function

Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the Brownian motion vector
(Wiener processes), specified as an NBrowns-by-NBrowns positive semidefinite matrix, or as a
deterministic function C(t) that accepts the current time t and returns an NBrowns-by-NBrowns
positive semidefinite correlation matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite
matrix, use nearcorr to create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.

A Correlation matrix represents a static condition.

As a deterministic function of time, Correlation allows you to specify a dynamic correlation
structure.

Data Types: double

Simulation — User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method
simulation by Euler approximation (simByEuler) (default) | function | SDE simulation method

User-defined simulation function or SDE simulation method, specified as a function or SDE simulation
method.

Data Types: function_handle
