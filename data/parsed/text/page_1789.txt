More About

Black Model

The Black model is a financial model used to price options on futures contracts.

Developed by Fischer Black in 1976, this model extends the Black-Scholes option pricing framework
to accommodate options on futures rather than stocks. The Black model is particularly useful in
situations where the underlying asset is a futures contract, which is common in commodities and
interest rate markets.
