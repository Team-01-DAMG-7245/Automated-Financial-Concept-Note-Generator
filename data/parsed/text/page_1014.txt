The solid red lines in the boxplot indicate that the median values and the bottom and top edges are

for the 25th and 75th percentiles. The "whiskers" are the minimum and maximum values, not
including outliers. The dotted lines represent the lower and upper bound constraints on the
coefficients. In this example, the coefficients cannot be negative, by construction.

To help decide which predictors to keep in the model, assess the proportion of times each coefficient
is zero.
