More About

Delta

A delta sensitivity measures the rate at which the price of an option is expected to change relative to
a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset.

Delta is not a static measure; it changes as the price of the underlying asset changes (a concept
known as gamma sensitivity), and as time passes. Options that are near the money or have longer
until expiration are more sensitive to changes in delta.

Delta values for call options range from 0 to 1. A delta close to 1 means the option price moves
almost in tandem with the stock price. And, delta values for put options ranges from -1 to 0. A delta
close to -1 means the option price moves inversely but almost in tandem with the stock price.
