Diversification Techniques

In this example, the two diversification measures are the equally weighted (EW) portfolio and the
most diversified portfolio (MDP).

You obtain the EW portfolio using the Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index as the diversification
measure

HH x = ∑
i = 1

n
xi
2

An equally weighted portfolio minimizes this index. Therefore, the portfolios that you obtain from
using this index as a penalty have weights that satisfy the portfolio constraints and are more evenly
weighted.

The diversification measure for the most diversified portfolio (MDP) is

MDP x = −∑
i = 1

n
σixi

where σi represents the standard deviation of asset i. Using this measure as a penalty function
maximizes the diversification ratio [1 on page 4-281].

φ x =
xTσ

xTΣx

If the portfolio is fully invested in one asset, or if all assets are perfectly correlated, the diversification
ratio φ x  is equal to 1. For all other cases, φ x > 1. Therefore, if φ x ≈1, there is no diversification,
so the goal is to maximize φ x . Unlike the HH index, the goal of MDP is not to obtain a portfolio
