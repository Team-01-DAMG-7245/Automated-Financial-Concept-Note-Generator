Settlement date, specified as an NINST-by-1 vector using a datetime array, string array, or date
character vectors. The Settle date is the date on which the cash flows are priced.

To support existing code, cfspread also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Name-Value Pair Arguments

Specify optional pairs of arguments as Name1=Value1,...,NameN=ValueN, where Name is the
argument name and Value is the corresponding value. Name-value arguments must appear after
other arguments, but the order of the pairs does not matter.

Before R2021a, use commas to separate each name and value, and enclose Name in quotes.

Note An optional input of size NINST-by-1 is also acceptable as a single value applicable to all
contracts. Single values are internally expanded to an array of size NINST-by-1.

Example: Spread =
cfspread(RateSpec,Price,CFlowAmounts,CFlowDates,Settle,'Basis',4)

Basis — Day-count basis
0 (actual/actual) (default) | positive integers of the set [1...13] | vector of positive integers of the
set [1...13]

Day-count basis, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Basis' and a positive integer
using a NINST-by-1 vector.

•
0 = actual/actual

•
1 = 30/360 (SIA)

•
2 = actual/360

•
3 = actual/365

•
4 = 30/360 (PSA)

•
5 = 30/360 (ISDA)

•
6 = 30/360 (European)

•
7 = actual/365 (Japanese)

•
8 = actual/actual (ICMA)

•
9 = actual/360 (ICMA)

•
10 = actual/365 (ICMA)

•
11 = 30/360E (ICMA)

•
12 = actual/365 (ISDA)

•
13 = BUS/252
