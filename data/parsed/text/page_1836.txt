bndconvy

Bond convexity given yield

Syntax

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvy(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)
[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvy( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvy(Yield,CouponRate,Settle,Maturity)
computes the convexity of NUMBONDS fixed income securities given a clean price for each bond.

bndconvy determines the convexity for a bond whether the first or last coupon periods in the coupon
structure are short or long (that is, whether the coupon structure is synchronized to maturity).
bndconvy also determines the convexity of a zero coupon bond.

[YearConvexity,PerConvexity] = bndconvy( ___ ,Name,Value) adds optional name-value
pair arguments.

Examples

Find Bond Convexity Given Yield

This example shows how to compute the convexity of a bond at three different yield values.

Yield = [0.04; 0.055; 0.06];  
CouponRate = 0.055; 
Settle = datetime(1999,8,2); 
Maturity = datetime(2004,6,15); 
Period = 2; 
Basis = 0;

[YearConvexity, PerConvexity]=bndconvy(Yield, CouponRate,... 
Settle, Maturity, Period, Basis)

YearConvexity = 3×1

21.4825
   21.0358
   20.8885

PerConvexity = 3×1

85.9298
   84.1434
   83.5541
