As both the tables and the plot show, the model coefficients match. You can be confident that this
implementation of fitConstrainedModel is well calibrated.

Constrained Model

In the constrained model approach, you solve for the values of the coefficients bi of the logistic model,
subject to constraints. The supported constraints are bound, equality, or inequality. The coefficients
maximize the likelihood-of-default function defined, for observation i, as:

Li = p Defaulti

yi × 1 −p Defaulti

1 −yi

where:

•
p Defaulti =
1

1 + e−bxi

•
b = b1 b2 . . . bK  is an unknown model coefficient

•
xi = xi1 x2 . . . xiK  is the predictor values at observation i

•
yi is the response value; a value of 1 represents default and a value of 0 represents non-default

This formula is for non-weighted data. When observation i has weight wi, it means that there are wi as
many observations i. Therefore, the probability that default occurs at observation i is the product of
the probabilities of default:

pi = p Defaulti

yi * p Defaulti

yi * . . . * p Defaulti

yi

wi times
= p Defaulti

wi * yi

Likewise, the probability of non-default for weighted observation i is:

pi = p
Defaulti

1 −yi * p
Defaulti

1 −yi * . . . * p
Defaulti

1 −yi

wi times
= 1 −p Defaulti

wi * 1 −yi
