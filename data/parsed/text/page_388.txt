In this figure, the upper-right parts of both the orange and purple efficient frontiers extend from the
CAL (lower-left red line), because of the leverage of a risk-free asset. The same levels of risk-awarded
returns are obtained. Once the portfolio exhausts the maximum allowed leverage, the efficient
frontier starts to fall below the CAL again, resulting in portfolios with lower Sharpe ratios.
