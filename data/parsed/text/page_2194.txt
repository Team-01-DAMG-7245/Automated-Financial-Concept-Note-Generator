ecmnhess

Hessian of negative log-likelihood function

Syntax

Hessian = ecmnhess(Data,Covariance)
Hessian = ecmnhess( ___ ,InvCovar,MatrixType)

Description

Hessian = ecmnhess(Data,Covariance) computes an NUMPARAMS-by-NUMPARAMS Hessian
matrix of the observed negative log-likelihood function based on current parameter estimates.

Use ecmnhess after estimating the mean and covariance of Data with ecmnmle.

Hessian = ecmnhess( ___ ,InvCovar,MatrixType) adds optional arguments for InvCovar and
MatrixType.

Examples

Compute Hessian for Negative Log-Likelihood Function for Data

This example shows how to compute the Hessian for the negative log-likelihood function for five years
of daily total return data for 12 computer technology stocks, with six hardware and six software
companies

The time period for this data extends from April 19, 2000 to April 18, 2005. The sixth stock in Assets
is Google (GOOG), which started trading on August 19, 2004. So, all returns before August 20, 2004
are missing and represented as NaNs. Also, Amazon (AMZN) had a few days with missing values
scattered throughout the past five years.

[ECMMean, ECMCovar] = ecmnmle(Data)

ECMMean = 12×1
