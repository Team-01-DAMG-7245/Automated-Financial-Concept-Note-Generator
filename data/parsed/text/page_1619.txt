When you specify true, simByEuler performs sampling such that all primary and antithetic paths
are simulated and stored in successive matching pairs:

•
Odd trials (1,3,5,...) correspond to the primary Gaussian paths.

•
Even trials (2,4,6,...) are the matching antithetic paths of each pair derived by negating the
Gaussian draws of the corresponding primary (odd) trial.

Note If you specify an input noise process (see Z), simByEuler ignores the value of Antithetic.

Data Types: logical

Z — Direct specification of the dependent random noise process for generating Brownian
motion vector
generates correlated Gaussian variates based on the Correlation member of the SDE object
(default) | function | three-dimensional array of dependent random variates

Direct specification of the dependent random noise process for generating the Brownian motion
vector (Wiener process) that drives the simulation, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting
of 'Z' and a function or as an (NPeriods ⨉ NSteps)-by-NBrowns-by-NTrials three-dimensional
array of dependent random variates.

Note If you specify Z as a function, it must return an NBrowns-by-1 column vector, and you must call
it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt

Data Types: double | function

N — Dependent random counting process for generating number of jumps
random numbers from Poisson distribution with parameter JumpFreq from a bates object (default) |
three-dimensional array | function

Dependent random counting process for generating the number of jumps, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'N' and a function or an (NPeriods ⨉ NSteps) -by-NJumps-by-NTrials
three-dimensional array of dependent random variates.

Note If you specify a function, N must return an NJumps-by-1 column vector, and you must call it
with two inputs: a real-valued scalar observation time t followed by an NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function

StorePaths — Flag that indicates how Paths is stored and returned
true (default) | logical with values true or false

Flag that indicates how the output array Paths is stored and returned, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'StorePaths' and a scalar numeric or logical 1 (true) or 0 (false).
