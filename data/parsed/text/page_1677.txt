dXt = B(t, Xt)Xtdt + D(t, Xt)V(t, xt)dWt + Y(t, Xt, Nt)XtdNt

Here:

•
Xt is an NVars-by-1 state vector of process variables.

•
B(t,Xt) is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of generalized expected instantaneous rates of return.

•
D(t,Xt) is an NVars-by-NVars diagonal matrix in which each element along the main diagonal is
the corresponding element of the state vector.

•
V(t,Xt) is an NVars-by-NVars matrix of instantaneous volatility rates.

•
dWt is an NBrowns-by-1 Brownian motion vector.

•
Y(t,Xt,Nt) is an NVars-by-NJumps matrix-valued jump size function.

•
dNt is an NJumps-by-1 counting process vector.
