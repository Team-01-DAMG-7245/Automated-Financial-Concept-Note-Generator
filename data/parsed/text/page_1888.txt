Note The default behavior is for SIA bases (0-7) to use the actual/actual day count to compute
discount factors, and for ICMA day counts (8 – 12) and BUS/252 to use the specified
DiscountBasis.

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although bndtotalreturn supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended
instead. The datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond
precision, and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)

y =

2021

There are no plans to remove support for serial date number inputs.
