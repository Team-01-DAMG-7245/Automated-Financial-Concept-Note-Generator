Take a baseline scenario of predictors, in this case, the latest known values of the age proxy AGE,
corporate profits forecast, CPF, and corporate spread, SPR. Then use the linear regression model to
compute a 95% confidence upper bound for the predicted default rate. The motivation for this is
illustrated in the last plot of the backtesting section, where the 95% confidence upper limit acts as a
conservative bound when the prediction underestimates the actual default rates.

tCrit = tinv(1-alpha/2,stats.tstat.dfe);
XLast = [AGE(end),CPF(end),SPR(end)];

yPred = [1 XLast]*stats.beta;
PredStd = sqrt([1 XLast]*stats.covb*[1 XLast]'+stats.mse);
yPredUB = yPred + tCrit*PredStd;

fprintf('\nPredicted default rate:\n');

Predicted default rate:

fprintf('     Baseline: %4.2f%%\n',yPred);

Baseline: 1.18%

fprintf('     %g%% Upper Bound: %4.2f%%\n',(1-alpha)*100,yPredUB);

95% Upper Bound: 2.31%

The next step is to incorporate stressed scenarios of the predictors in the analysis. CPF and SPR can
change in the short term, whereas AGE cannot. This is important. The corporate profits forecast and
the corporate spread are influenced by world events, including, for example, natural disasters. These
predictors can significantly change overnight. On the other hand, AGE depends on managerial
decisions that can alter the proportion of old and new loans in time, but these decisions take months,
if not years, to reflect in the AGE time series. Scenarios for AGE are compatible with longer term
analyses. Here you look at one year ahead only, and keep AGE fixed for the remainder of this section.

It is convenient to define the predicted default rate and the confidence bounds as functions of CPF
and SPR to simplify the scenario analysis.

yPredFn = @(cpf,spr) [1 AGE(end) cpf spr]*stats.beta;
PredStdFn = @(cpf,spr) sqrt([1 AGE(end) cpf spr]*stats.covb*...
   [1 AGE(end) cpf spr]'+stats.mse);
yPredUBFn = @(cpf,spr) (yPredFn(cpf,spr) + tCrit*PredStdFn(cpf,spr));
yPredLBFn = @(cpf,spr) (yPredFn(cpf,spr) - tCrit*PredStdFn(cpf,spr));

Two extreme scenarios of interest can be a drop in the corporate profits forecast of 4% relative to the
baseline, and an increase in the corporate spread of 100 basis points over the baseline.

Moving one predictor at a time is not unreasonable in this case, because the correlation between CPF
and SPR is very low. Moderate correlation levels may require perturbing predictors together to get
more reliable results. Highly correlated predictors usually do not coexist in the same model, since
they offer redundant information.
