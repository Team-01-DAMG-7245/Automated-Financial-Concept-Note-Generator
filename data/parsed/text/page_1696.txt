Note If you specify Z as a function, it must return an NBrowns-by-1 column vector, and you must call
it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.

Data Types: double | function

StorePaths — Flag that indicates how output array Paths is stored and returned
True (default) | logical with values True or False

Flag that indicates how the output array Paths is stored and returned, specified as the comma-
separated pair consisting of 'StorePaths' and a scalar logical flag with a value of True or False.

•
If StorePaths is True (the default value) or is unspecified, simByEuler returns Paths as a
three-dimensional time series array.

•
If StorePaths is False (logical 0), simByEuler returns the Paths output array as an empty
matrix.

Data Types: logical

MonteCarloMethod — Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes
"standard" (default) | string with values "standard", "quasi", or "randomized-quasi" |
character vector with values 'standard', 'quasi', or 'randomized-quasi'

Monte Carlo method to simulate stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'MonteCarloMethod' and a string or character vector with one of the following
values:

•
"standard" — Monte Carlo using pseudo random numbers

•
"quasi" — Quasi-Monte Carlo using low-discrepancy sequences

•
"randomized-quasi" — Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo

Note If you specify an input noise process (see Z), simByEuler ignores the value of
MonteCarloMethod.

Data Types: string | char

QuasiSequence — Low discrepancy sequence to drive stochastic processes
"sobol" (default) | string with value "sobol" | character vector with value 'sobol'

Low discrepancy sequence to drive the stochastic processes, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'QuasiSequence' and a string or character vector with the following value:

•
"sobol" — Quasi-random low-discrepancy sequences that use a base of two to form successively
finer uniform partitions of the unit interval and then reorder the coordinates in each dimension.

Note If MonteCarloMethod option is not specified or specified as"standard", QuasiSequence is
ignored.
