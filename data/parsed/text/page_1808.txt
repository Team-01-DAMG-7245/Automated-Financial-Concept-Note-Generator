blsrho

Black-Scholes sensitivity to interest-rate change

Syntax

[CallRho,PutRho] = blsrho(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility)
[CallRho,PutRho] = blsrho( ___ ,Yield)

Description

[CallRho,PutRho] = blsrho(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns the call option
rho CallRho, and the put option rho PutRho. Rho is the rate of change in value of derivative
securities with respect to interest rates. blsrho uses normcdf, the normal cumulative distribution
function in the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

In addition, you can use the Financial Instruments Toolbox object framework with the BlackScholes
pricer object to obtain price and rho values for a Vanilla, Barrier, Touch, DoubleTouch, or
Binary instrument using a BlackScholes model.

Note blsrho can also handle an underlying asset such as currencies. When pricing currencies
(Garman-Kohlhagen model), enter the input argument Yield as:

Yield = ForeignRate

where ForeignRate is the continuously compounded, annualized risk-free interest rate in the
foreign country.

[CallRho,PutRho] = blsrho( ___ ,Yield) adds an optional argument for Yield.

Examples

Find the Black-Scholes Sensitivity (Rho) to Interest-Rate Change

This example shows how to find the Black-Scholes sensitivity, rho, to interest-rate change.

[CallRho, PutRho] = blsrho(50, 50, 0.12, 0.25, 0.3, 0)

CallRho = 
6.6686

PutRho = 
-5.4619
