Note The elements of Subset must be contained in Superset, without repetition. datefind works
with non-repeating sequences of dates.

Example: Subset = [datetime(1997,7,10); datetime(1997,7,20)];

To support existing code, datefind also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Superset — Superset of dates
datetime array | string array | date character vector

Superset of dates, specified as a matrix of using a datetime array, string array, or date character
vectors, whose elements are sought.

Subset and Superset can be either a datetime array, string array, or date character vectors. These
types do not have to match. datefind determines the underlying date to match dates of different
data types.

Note The elements of Subset must be contained in Superset, without repetition. datefind works
with non-repeating sequences of dates.

Example: Superset = datetime(1997,7,1:31);

To support existing code, datefind also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Tolerance — Tolerance for matching dates in Superset
0 (default) | positive integer or duration object

Tolerance for matching dates (+/-) in Superset, specified as a positive integer or duration object.

Data Types: single | double

Output Arguments

Indices — Indices of dates in Superset that are present in Subset
vector

Indices of dates in Superset that are present in Subset (plus or minus the tolerance if defined using
the optional argument Tolerance), returned as a vector of indices.
