In this example, you would set the LowerGroup property to be empty ([]).

Suppose that you want to add another group constraint to make odd-numbered assets constitute at
least 20% of your portfolio. Set up an augmented group matrix and introduce infinite bounds for
unconstrained group bounds or use the addGroups function to build up group constraints. For this
example, create another group matrix for the second group constraint:

p = Portfolio;
G = [ true true true false false ];    % group matrix for first group constraint
p = setGroups(p, G, [], 0.3);
G = [ true false true false true ];    % group matrix for second group constraint
p = addGroups(p, G, 0.2);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupMatrix)
disp(p.LowerGroup)
disp(p.UpperGroup)

addGroups determines which bounds are unbounded so you only need to focus on the constraints
that you want to set.

The Portfolio object and setGroups and addGroups implement scalar expansion on either the
LowerGroup or UpperGroup properties based on the dimension of the group matrix in the property
GroupMatrix. Suppose that you have a universe of 30 assets with six asset classes such that assets
1–5, assets 6–12, assets 13–18, assets 19–22, assets 23–27, and assets 28–30 constitute each of your
six asset classes and you want each asset class to fall from 0% to 25% of your portfolio. Let the
following group matrix define your groups and scalar expansion define the common bounds on each
group:

p = Portfolio;
G = blkdiag(true(1,5), true(1,7), true(1,6), true(1,4), true(1,5), true(1,3));
p = setGroups(p, G, 0, 0.25);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.GroupMatrix)
disp(p.LowerGroup)
disp(p.UpperGroup)
