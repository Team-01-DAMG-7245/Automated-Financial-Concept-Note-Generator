Determining Specific Dates

Financial Toolbox provides many functions for determining specific dates. For example, assume that
you schedule an accounting procedure for the last Friday of every month. Use the lweekdate
function to return those dates for the year 2000. The input argument 6 specifies Friday.

Fridates = lweekdate(6,2000,1:12);
Fridays = datestr(Fridates)

Fridays =

12×11 char array

'28-Jan-2000'
    '25-Feb-2000'
    '31-Mar-2000'
    '28-Apr-2000'
    '26-May-2000'
    '30-Jun-2000'
    '28-Jul-2000'
    '25-Aug-2000'
    '29-Sep-2000'
    '27-Oct-2000'
    '24-Nov-2000'
    '29-Dec-2000'

Another example of needing specific dates could be that your company closes on Martin Luther King
Jr. Day, which is the third Monday in January. You can use the nweekdate function to determine those
specific dates for 2011 through 2014.

MLKDates = nweekdate(3,2,2011:2014,1);
MLKDays = datestr(MLKDates)

MLKDays =

4×11 char array

'17-Jan-2011'
    '16-Jan-2012'
    '21-Jan-2013'
    '20-Jan-2014'

Determining Holidays

Accounting for holidays and other nontrading days is important when you examine financial dates.
Financial Toolbox provides the holidays function, which contains holidays and special nontrading
days for the New York Stock Exchange from 1950 through 2030, inclusive. In addition, you can use
nyseclosures to evaluate all known or anticipated closures of the New York Stock Exchange from
