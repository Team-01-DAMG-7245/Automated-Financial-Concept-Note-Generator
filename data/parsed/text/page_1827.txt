Output Arguments

ProbabilityData — Default probability values
matrix

Default probability values, returned as a P-by-2 matrix with dates and corresponding cumulative
default probability values. The dates match those in MarketData, unless the optional input
parameter ProbabilityDates is provided.

HazardData — Hazard rate values
matrix

Hazard rate values, returned as an N-by-2 matrix with dates and corresponding hazard rate values for
the survival probability model. The dates match those in MarketData.

Note A warning is displayed when nonmonotone default probabilities (that is, negative hazard rates)
are found.

Bootstrap Default Probability

A default probability curve can be bootstrapped from a collection of bond market quotes.

Extracting discrete default probabilities for a certain period from market bond data is represented by
the formula

Price = Disc(tN) × FV × Q(tN) + C
f × ∑
i = 1

N
Disc(ti) × Q(ti) + ∑
(i = 1)

N
Disc(ti) × R(ti) × (Q(ti −1) −Q(ti))

where:

FV — Face value

Q — Survival probability

C — Coupon

R — Recovery amount

f — Payment frequency (for example, 2 for semiannual coupon bonds)

The default probability is:

DefaultProbability = 1 – SurvivalProbability
