If you specify Speed as an array, it must be a scalar.

If you specify Speed as a deterministic function of time, you call Speed with a real-valued scalar time
t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify Speed as a function of time and state, the function calculates the speed of mean
reversion. This function must return a scalar of reversion rates when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
A 2-by-1 bivariate state vector Xt

Note Although bates enforces no restrictions on Speed, the mean-reversion speed is nonnegative
such that the underlying process reverts to some stable level.

Level — Reversion level or long-run average of CIR stochastic variance process
array | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Reversion level or long-run average of the CIR stochastic variance process, specified as an array, or
deterministic function of time.

If you specify Level as an array, it must be a scalar.

If you specify Level as a deterministic function of time, you call Level with a real-valued scalar time
t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify Level as a deterministic function of time and state, it must return a scalar of reversion
levels when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t

•
A 2-by-1 bivariate state vector Xt

Volatility — Instantaneous volatility CIR stochastic variance process
scalar | deterministic function of time | deterministic function of time and state

Instantaneous volatility of the CIR stochastic variance process (often called the volatility of volatility
or volatility of variance), specified as a scalar, a deterministic function of time, or a deterministic
function of time and state.

If you specify Volatility as a scalar, it represents the instantaneous volatility of the CIR stochastic
variance model.

If you specify Volatility as a deterministic function of time, you call Volatility with a real-
valued scalar time t as its only input, it must return a scalar.

If you specify Volatility as a deterministic function time and state, Volatility must return a
scalar when you call it with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t
