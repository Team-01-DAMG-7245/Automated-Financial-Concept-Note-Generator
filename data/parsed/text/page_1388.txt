•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.

Note You can specify combinations of array and function input parameters as needed.

Moreover, a parameter is identified as a deterministic function of time if the function accepts a scalar
time t as its only input argument. Otherwise, a parameter is assumed to be a function of time t and
state X(t) and is invoked with both input arguments.

CIR = cir( ___ ,Name,Value) creates a CIR object with additional options specified by one or
more Name,Value pair arguments.

Name is a property name and Value is its corresponding value. Name must appear inside single
quotes (''). You can specify several name-value pair arguments in any order as Name1,Value1,
…,NameN,ValueN

The CIR object has the following “Properties” on page 15-83:

•
StartTime — Initial observation time

•
StartState — Initial state at time StartTime

•
Correlation — Access function for the Correlation input argument, callable as a function of
time

•
Drift — Composite drift-rate function, callable as a function of time and state

•
Diffusion — Composite diffusion-rate function, callable as a function of time and state

•
Simulation — A simulation function or method

•
Speed — Access function for the input argument Speed, callable as a function of time and state

•
Level — Access function for the input argument Level, callable as a function of time and state

•
Sigma — Access function for the input argument Sigma, callable as a function of time and state

Input Arguments

Speed — Speed represents the parameter S
array or deterministic function of time or deterministic function of time and state

Speed represents the parameter S, specified as an array or deterministic function of time.

If you specify Speed as an array, it must be an NVars-by-NVars matrix of mean-reversion speeds (the
rate at which the state vector reverts to its long-run average Level).

As a deterministic function of time, when Speed is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Speed must produce an NVars-by-NVars matrix. If you specify Speed as a function of time and
state, it calculates the speed of mean reversion. This function must generate an NVars-by-NVars
matrix of reversion rates when called with two inputs:

•
A real-valued scalar observation time t.

•
An NVars-by-1 state vector Xt.
