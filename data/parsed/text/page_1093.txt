The residual errors V(i) are assumed to have moments

E[V(i)] = 0

and

E[V(i) * V(j)] = S(i,j)

for assets i,j = 1, ... , n, where the parameters S(1,1), ... , S(n,n) are called residual
or non-systematic variances/covariances.

The square root of the residual variance of each asset, i.e., sqrt(S(i,i)) for i = 1, ... , n, is
said to be the residual or non-systematic risk of the asset since it characterizes the residual variation
in asset prices that cannot be explained by variations in market prices.

Estimation with Missing Data

Although betas can be estimated for companies with sufficiently long histories of asset returns, it is
extremely difficult to estimate betas for recent IPOs. However, if a collection of sufficiently-
observable companies exists that can be expected to have some degree of correlation with the new
company's stock price movements, for example, companies within the same industry as the new
company, then it is possible to obtain imputed estimates for new company betas with the missing-data
regression routines in the Financial Toolbox™.

Separate Estimation of Some Technology Stock Betas

To illustrate how to use the missing-data regression routines, we will estimate betas for twelve
technology stocks, where one stock (GOOG) is an IPO.

First, load dates, total returns, and ticker symbols for the twelve stocks from the MAT-file
CAPMuniverse.
