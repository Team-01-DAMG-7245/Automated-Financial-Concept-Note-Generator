More About

Fisher Information Matrix

The Fisher information matrix is a key concept in statistics and information theory that measures the
amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter upon
which the probability of the random variable depends.

The Fisher information matrix is used to evaluate the efficiency of estimators and to derive
confidence intervals.
