Use equityCurve to plot the equity curve to compare the performance of both strategies.

The maximum and average turnover are decreased using covariance shrinkage. Also, the covariance
shrinkage strategy results in a decrease of buy and sell costs. In this example, not only is the turnover
decreased, but also the volatility and the maximum drawdown are decreased. Therefore, in this
example the shrunk covariance produces more robust weights.

Local Functions

function new_weights = traditionalStrat(~, pricesTT) 
% Function for minimum variance portfolio using traditional covariance estimate.

% Compute the returns from the prices timetable.
assetReturns = tick2ret(pricesTT);
mu = mean(assetReturns.Variables);
Sigma = cov(assetReturns.Variables,"omitrows");

% Create the portfolio problem.
p = Portfolio(AssetMean=mu,AssetCovar=Sigma);
% Specify long-only fully invested contraints.
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);

% Compute the minimum variance portfolio.
new_weights = estimateFrontierLimits(p,'min');
