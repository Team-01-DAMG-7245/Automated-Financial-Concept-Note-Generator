FutureVal = 
1.0731e+03

Input Arguments

CashFlow — Varying cash flows
vector

Varying cash flows, specified as a vector.

Note You must include the initial investment as the initial cash flow value (a negative number).

.

Data Types: double

Rate — Periodic Interest rate
scalar numeric decimal

Periodic interest rate, specified as a scalar numeric decimal.

Data Types: double

CFDates — Dates on which the cash flows occur
assumes CashFlow contains regular (periodic) cash flows (default) | datetime array | string array |
date character vector | serial date number

(Optional) Dates on which the cash flows occur, specified as a vector using a datetime array, string
array, or date character vectors.

Note Use CFDates for irregular (nonperiodic) cash flows.

To support existing code, fvvar also accepts serial date numbers as inputs, but they are not
recommended.

Data Types: char | string | datetime

Output Arguments

FutureVal — Future value of a varying cash flow
scalar numeric

Future value of a varying cash flow, returned as a scalar numeric.
