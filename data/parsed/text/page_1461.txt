Note Unlike simulation methods, the interpolation function does not support user-specified noise
processes.

•
The interpolate function assumes that all model parameters are piecewise-constant, and
evaluates them from the most recent observation time in Times that precedes a specified
interpolation time in T. This is consistent with the Euler approach of Monte Carlo simulation.

•
When an interpolation time falls outside the interval specified by Times, a Euler simulation
extrapolates the time series by using the nearest available observation.

•
The user-defined time series Paths and corresponding observation Times must be fully observed
(no missing observations denoted by NaNs).

•
The interpolate function assumes that the user-specified time series array Paths is associated
with the sde object. For example, the Times and Paths input pair are the result of an initial
course-grained simulation. However, the interpolation ignores the initial conditions of the sde
object (StartTime and StartState), allowing the user-specified Times and Paths input series
to take precedence.
