Setting Default Constraints Using the setDefaultConstraints Function

An alternative approach is to use the setDefaultConstraints function. If the number of assets is
already known in a Portfolio object, use setDefaultConstraints with no arguments to set up
the necessary bound and budget constraints. Suppose that you have 20 assets to set up the portfolio
set for a default problem:

p = Portfolio('NumAssets', 20);
p = setDefaultConstraints(p);
disp(p)
