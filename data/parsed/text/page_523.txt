As expected, the robust strategy has lower volatility than the traditional mean-variance strategy. This
characteristic is observed in all the performance indicators that measure variability: volatility,
turnover, and maximum drawdown. This result is the expected outcome of robust strategies. Although
it is not always the case, in this particular example, the robust strategy also outperforms the
traditional mean-variance allocation.
