heston

Heston model

Description

Creates and displays a heston object, which derives from the sdeddo (SDE from drift and diffusion
objects).

Use heston objects to simulate sample paths of two state variables. Each state variable is driven by a
single Brownian motion source of risk over NPeriods consecutive observation periods,
approximating continuous-time stochastic volatility processes.

Heston models are bivariate composite models. Each Heston model consists of two coupled univariate
models:

•
A geometric Brownian motion (gbm) model with a stochastic volatility function.

dX1t = B(t)X1tdt +
X2tX1tdW1t

This model usually corresponds to a price process whose volatility (variance rate) is governed by
the second univariate model.

•
A Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (cir) square root diffusion model.

dX2t = S(t)[L(t) −X2t]dt + V(t) X2tdW2t

This model describes the evolution of the variance rate of the coupled GBM price process.

Creation

Syntax

Heston = heston(Return,Speed,Level,Volatility)
Heston = heston( ___ ,Name,Value)

Description

Heston = heston(Return,Speed,Level,Volatility) creates a default heston object.

Specify the required input parameters as one of the following types:

•
A MATLAB array. Specifying an array indicates a static (non-time-varying) parametric
specification. This array fully captures all implementation details, which are clearly associated
with a parametric form.

•
A MATLAB function. Specifying a function provides indirect support for virtually any static,
dynamic, linear, or nonlinear model. This parameter is supported via an interface, because all
implementation details are hidden and fully encapsulated by the function.
