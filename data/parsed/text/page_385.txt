Leverage in Portfolio Optimization with a Risk-Free Asset

This example shows how to use the setBudget function for the Portfolio class to define the limits
on the sum(AssetWeight_i) in risky assets.

If the sum(AssetWeight_i) is less than 1, the extra cash is invested in a risk-free asset. If the
sum(AssetWeight_i) is larger than 1, meaning that total risky asset investment is larger than
initial available cash, the risk-free asset is shorted (borrowed) to fund the extra investment in a risky
asset. The cost associated with borrowing a risk-free asset is automatically captured in the mean-
variance optimization model for the Portfolio class. Therefore, you can use the setBudget
function directly to control the level of leverage of cash for the portfolio.

Portfolio Without Leverage

Consider the following example that does not leverage a risk-free asset.

assetsMean = [ 0.05; 0.1; 0.12; 0.18; ];
assetCovar = [ 0.0064 0.00408 0.00192 0; 
    0.00408 0.0289 0.0204 0.0119;
    0.00192 0.0204 0.0576 0.0336;
    0 0.0119 0.0336 0.1225];
riskFreeRate = 0.03;

% create a portfolio and define risk-free rate.
p = Portfolio('RiskFreeRate', riskFreeRate, 'assetmean', assetsMean, 'assetcovar', assetCovar, 'l

Create multiple portfolios with different budgets on risky assets to control the limits for investing in a
risk-free asset.

p = setBudget(p, 1, 1);     % allow 0% risk free asset allocation, meaning fully invested in risk
p1 = setBudget(p, 0, 1);    % allow 0% to 100% risk free asset allocation
p2 = setBudget(p, 0.7, 1);  % allow 0% to 30% risk free asset allocation
[risk, retn] = estimatePortMoments(p, estimateMaxSharpeRatio(p));

figure;
plotFrontier(p); hold on; 
plotFrontier(p1);hold on;
plotFrontier(p2); hold on;
plot(risk, retn, 'g*'); hold off;
