When to Use Portfolio Objects Over Optimization Toolbox

While you can use Optimization Toolbox to solve portfolio optimization problems, Financial Toolbox
has the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, and PortfolioMAD objects that you can use as well. Which
tool you use depends on the problem case:

•
Always use a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object when the problem can
most easily be written and implemented using one of these objects. This case includes problems
that can be solved only with the internal solvers of the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or
PortfolioMAD object. The Optimization Toolbox solvers cannot directly handle these problems.
For details, see “Always Use Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD Object” on page 4-134.

•
Prefer to use a Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object when the problem can be
modeled and implemented using both the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object
and the Optimization Toolbox problem-based framework. The advantage of using a Portfolio,
PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object instead of the Optimization Toolbox is that the internal
tools of these objects simplify the analysis. For details, see “Preferred Use of Portfolio,
PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD Object” on page 4-135.

•
Opt to use Optimization Toolbox for problems that cannot be solved with the internal solvers of
the Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object. Some of the problems that the
Portfolio, PortfolioCVaR, or PortfolioMAD object cannot solve can be addressed using the
Optimization Toolbox problem-based framework. Problems that cannot be directly solved with
either framework require either some restructuring of the model or an implementation of a
specialized solver. For details, see “Use Optimization Toolbox” on page 4-136.

The following table summarizes the objective functions, constraints, and variables that apply in each
case for solving a portfolio problem.
