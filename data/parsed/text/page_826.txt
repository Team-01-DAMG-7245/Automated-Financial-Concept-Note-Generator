Working with Transaction Costs

The difference between net and gross portfolio returns is transaction costs. The net portfolio return
proxy has distinct proportional costs to purchase and to sell assets which are maintained in the
PortfolioMAD object properties BuyCost and SellCost. Transaction costs are in units of total
return and, as such, are proportional to the price of an asset so that they enter the model for net
portfolio returns in return form. For example, suppose that you have a stock currently priced $40 and
your usual transaction costs are 5 cents per share. Then the transaction cost for the stock is 0.05/40
= 0.00125 (as defined in “Net Portfolio Returns” on page 6-4). Costs are entered as positive values
and credits are entered as negative values.

Setting Transaction Costs Using the PortfolioMAD Function

To set up transaction costs, you must specify an initial or current portfolio in the InitPort property.
If the initial portfolio is not set when you set up the transaction cost properties, InitPort is 0. The
properties for transaction costs can be set using the PortfolioMAD object. For example, assume that
purchase and sale transaction costs are in the variables bc and sc and an initial portfolio is in the
variable x0, then transaction costs are set:

bc = [ 0.00125; 0.00125; 0.00125; 0.00125; 0.00125 ];
sc = [ 0.00125; 0.007; 0.00125; 0.00125; 0.0024 ];
x0 = [ 0.4; 0.2; 0.2; 0.1; 0.1 ];
p = PortfolioMAD('BuyCost', bc, 'SellCost', sc, 'InitPort', x0);
disp(p.NumAssets)
disp(p.BuyCost)
disp(p.SellCost)
disp(p.InitPort)

Setting Transaction Costs Using the setCosts Function

You can also set the properties for transaction costs using setCosts. Assume that you have the same
costs and initial portfolio as in the previous example. Given a PortfolioMAD object p with an initial
portfolio already set, use setCosts to set up transaction costs:
