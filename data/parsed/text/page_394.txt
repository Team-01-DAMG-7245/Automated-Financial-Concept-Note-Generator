When you use the values for the blended asset return and the covariance from the Black-Litterman
model in a mean-variance optimization, the optimal allocations reflect the views of the investment
analyst directly. The allocation from the Black-Litterman model is more diversified, as the pie chart
shows. Also, the weights among the assets in the Black-Litterman model agree with the investment
analyst views. For example, when you compare the Black-Litterman result with the plain mean-
variance optimization result, you can see that the Black-Litterman result is more heavily invested in
MSFT than in IBM. This is because the investment analyst has a strong view that MSFT will
outperform IBM.

function [wtsMarket, PI] = findMarketPortfolioAndImpliedReturn(assetRetn, benchRetn)
% Find the market portfolio that tracks the benchmark and its corresponding implied expected retu

The implied return is calculated by reverse optimization. The risk-free rate is assumed to be zero. The
general formulation of a portfolio optimization is given by the Markowitz optimization problem:
