More About

Lambda

A lambda sensitivity measures the percentage change in an option's price for a 1% change in the
price of the underlying asset.

Lambda is a measure of leverage, indicating how much more sensitive an option is to price
movements in the underlying asset compared to owning the asset outright. For example, if an option
has a lambda of 3, it means that if the underlying asset's price moves by 1%, the option's price is
expected to move by 3%.
