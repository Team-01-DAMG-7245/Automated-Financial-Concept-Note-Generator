SDE Class Hierarchy

The Financial Toolbox SDE class structure represents a generalization and specialization hierarchy.
The top-level class provides the most general model interface and offers the default Monte Carlo
simulation and interpolation methods. In turn, derived classes offer restricted interfaces that simplify
model creation and manipulation while providing detail regarding model structure.

The following table lists the SDE classes. The introductory examples in “Available SDE Models” on
page 14-11 show how to use these classes to create objects associated with univariate models.
Although the Financial Toolbox SDE engine supports multivariate models, univariate models facilitate
object creation and display, and allow you to easily associate inputs with object parameters.
