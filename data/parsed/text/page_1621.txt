Note If an input noise process is specified using the Z input argument, BrownianMotionMethod is
ignored.

The starting point for a Monte Carlo simulation is the construction of a Brownian motion sample path
(or Wiener path). Such paths are built from a set of independent Gaussian variates, using either
standard discretization, Brownian-bridge construction, or principal components construction.

Both standard discretization and Brownian-bridge construction share the same variance and,
therefore, the same resulting convergence when used with the MonteCarloMethod using pseudo
random numbers. However, the performance differs between the two when the MonteCarloMethod
option "quasi" is introduced, with faster convergence for the "brownian-bridge" construction
option and the fastest convergence for the "principal-components" construction option.

Processes — Sequence of end-of-period processes or state vector adjustments
simByEuler makes no adjustments and performs no processing (default) | function | cell array of
functions

Sequence of end-of-period processes or state vector adjustments, specified as the comma-separated
pair consisting of 'Processes' and a function or cell array of functions of the form

Xt = P(t, Xt)

The simByEuler function runs processing functions at each interpolation time. The functions must
accept the current interpolation time t, and the current state vector Xt and return a state vector that
can be an adjustment to the input state.

If you specify more than one processing function, simByEuler invokes the functions in the order in
which they appear in the cell array. You can use this argument to specify boundary conditions,
prevent negative prices, accumulate statistics, and plot graphs.

The end-of-period Processes argument allows you to terminate a given trial early. At the end of each
time step, simByEuler tests the state vector Xt for an all-NaN condition. Thus, to signal an early
termination of a given trial, all elements of the state vector Xt must be NaN. This test enables you to
define a Processes function to signal early termination of a trial, and offers significant performance
benefits in some situations (for example, pricing down-and-out barrier options).

Output Arguments

Paths — Simulated paths of correlated state variables
array

Simulated paths of correlated state variables, returned as an (NPeriods + 1)-by-NVars-by-
NTrials three-dimensional time series array.

For a given trial, each row of Paths is the transpose of the state vector Xt at time t. When
StorePaths is set to false, simByEuler returns Paths as an empty matrix.

Times — Observation times associated with simulated paths
column vector
