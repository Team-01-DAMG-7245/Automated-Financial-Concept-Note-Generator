Compute Commodity Price Returns

To further analyze the data in this example, you must work with the commodity price returns rather
than the adjusted commodity prices. Use tick2ret to convert the adjusted commodity prices Pt to
the return series Rt as follows:

Rt = Pt + 1
Pt
−1,
t = 1, 2, 3, …

Returns = tick2ret(Prices);
