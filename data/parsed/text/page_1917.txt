cdai

Accrued interest on certificate of deposit

Syntax

AccrInt = cdai(CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate)
AccrInt = cdai( ___ ,Basis)

Description

AccrInt = cdai(CouponRate,Settle,Maturity,IssueDate) computes the accrued interest
on a certificate of deposit.

cdai assumes that the certificates of deposit pay interest at maturity. Because of the simple interest
treatment of these securities, this function is best used for short-term maturities (less than 1 year).
The default simple interest calculation uses the Basis for the actual/360 convention (2).

AccrInt = cdai( ___ ,Basis) adds an optional argument for Basis.

Examples

Find the Accrued Interest on a Certificate of Deposit

This example shows how to compute the accrued interest due, given a certificate of deposit with the
following characteristics.

CouponRate      =  0.05;
Settle          =  '02-Jan-02';
Maturity        =  '31-Mar-02';
IssueDate       =  '1-Oct-01';

AccrInt = cdai(CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, IssueDate)

AccrInt = 
1.2917

Find the Accrued Interest on a Certificate of Deposit Using datetime Inputs

This example shows how to use datetime inputs to compute the accrued interest due, given a
certificate of deposit with the following characteristics.

CouponRate =  0.05;
Settle =  datetime('02-Jan-02','Locale','en_US');
Maturity =  datetime('31-Mar-02','Locale','en_US');
IssueDate =  datetime('1-Oct-01','Locale','en_US');
AccrInt = cdai(CouponRate, Settle, Maturity, IssueDate)

AccrInt = 
1.2917
