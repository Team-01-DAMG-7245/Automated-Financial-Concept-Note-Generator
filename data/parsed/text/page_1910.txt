Examples

Determine Business Days for a Given Period

Determine the business days for a weekly period.

bdates = datestr(busdays('1/2/01','1/9/01','weekly'))

bdates = 2×11 char array
    '05-Jan-2001'
    '12-Jan-2001'

The end of the week is considered to be a Friday. Between 1/2/01 (Monday) and 1/9/01 (Tuesday),
there is only one end-of-week day, 1/5/01 (Friday). Because 1/9/01 is part of the following week, the
following Friday (1/12/01) is also reported.

Determine the business days for a weekly period using a datetime input for sdate.

bdates = busdays(datetime('2-Jan-2001','Locale','en_US'),'9-Jan-2001','weekly')

bdates = 2×1 datetime
   05-Jan-2001
   12-Jan-2001

Determine the business days for a monthly period.

vec = datestr(busdays('1/8/16','3/1/16','monthly'))

vec = 3×11 char array
    '29-Jan-2016'
