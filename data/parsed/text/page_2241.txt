Example: p = estimateAssetMoments(p,Y,'dataformat','prices')

DataFormat — Flag to convert input data as prices into returns
'Returns' (default) | character vector with values 'Returns' or 'Prices'

Flag to convert input data as prices into returns, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of
'DataFormat' and a character vector with the values:

•
'Returns' — Data in AssetReturns contains asset total returns.

•
'Prices' — Data in AssetReturns contains asset total return prices.

Data Types: char

MissingData — Flag indicating whether to use ECM algorithm or exclude samples with NaN
values
false (default) | logical with value true or false

Flag indicating whether to use ECM algorithm or excludes samples with NaN values, specified as the
comma-separated pair consisting of 'MissingData' and a logical with a value of true or false.

To handle time series with missing data (indicated with NaN values), the MissingData flag either
uses the ECM algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates in the presences of NaN values or
excludes samples with NaN values. Since the default is false, it is necessary to specify
MissingData as true to use the ECM algorithm.

Acceptable values for MissingData are:

•
false — Do not use ECM algorithm to handle NaN values (exclude NaN values).

•
true — Use ECM algorithm to handle NaN values.

For more information on the ECM algorithm, see ecmnmle and “Multivariate Normal Regression” on
page 9-2.

Data Types: logical

GetAssetList — Flag indicating which asset names to use for asset list
false (default) | logical with value true or false

Flag indicating which asset names to use for the asset list, specified as the comma-separated pair
consisting of 'GetAssetList' and a logical with a value of true or false. Acceptable values for
GetAssetList are:

•
false — Do not extract or create asset names.

•
true — Extract or create asset names from a table or timetable object.

If a table or timetable is passed into this function using the AssetReturns argument and the
GetAssetList flag is true, the column names from the table or timetable object are used as asset
names in obj.AssetList.

If a matrix is passed and the GetAssetList flag is true, default asset names are created based on
the AbstractPortfolio property defaultforAssetList, which is 'Asset'.

If the GetAssetList flag is false, no action occurs, which is the default behavior.
