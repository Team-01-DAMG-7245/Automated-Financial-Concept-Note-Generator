This plot shows how the penalized strategy returns weights that are between the minimum variance
portfolio and the EW portfolio. In fact, choosing λHH = 0 returns the minimum variance solution, and
as λHH →∞, the solution approaches the EW portfolio.

Most Diversified Portfolio

The diversification index associated to the most diversified portfolio (MDP) is defined as

MDP x = −∑
i = 1

n
σixi

where σi represents the standard deviation of asset i.

The MDP is the portfolio that maximizes the diversification ratio:

φ x =
xTσ

xTΣx

The diversification ratio φ x  is equal to 1 if the portfolio is fully invested in one asset or if all assets
are perfectly correlated. For all other cases, φ x > 1. If φ x ≈1, there is no diversification, so the
goal is to find the portfolio that maximizes φ x :

max
x ∈X

σTx

xTΣx

Unlike the HH index, the MDP goal is not to obtain a portfolio whose weights are evenly distributed
among all assets, but to obtain a portfolio whose selected (nonzero) assets have the same correlation
to the portfolio as a whole. Use the function handle MDPObjFun for the most diversified portfolio
(MDP) with the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function.
