Data Types: double

Output Arguments

ZeroRates — Zero curve for investment horizon represented by CurveDates
vector

Zero curve for the investment horizon represented by CurveDates, returned as a NDATES-by-1
column vector of decimal fractions. The zero rates are the yields to maturity on theoretical zero-
coupon bonds.

CurveDates — Maturity dates that correspond to ZeroRates
vector

Maturity dates that correspond to the ZeroRates, returned as a NDATES-by-1 column vector. This
vector is the same as the input vector CurveDates, but the output is sorted by ascending maturity. If
either inputs for CurveDates or Settle are datetime arrays, the output CurveDates is returned as
datetime arrays.

Version History
Introduced before R2006a

R2022b: Serial date numbers not recommended
Not recommended starting in R2022b

Although disc2zero supports serial date numbers, datetime values are recommended instead. The
datetime data type provides flexible date and time formats, storage out to nanosecond precision,
and properties to account for time zones and daylight saving time.

To convert serial date numbers or text to datetime values, use the datetime function. For example:

t = datetime(738427.656845093,"ConvertFrom","datenum");
y = year(t)
