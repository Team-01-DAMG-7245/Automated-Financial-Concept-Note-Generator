In this\nexample, the tracking error becomes a soft constraint and the strength of the constraint is controlled\nwith the penalty parameter λ ≥0. The larger λ is, the stronger the tracking error constraint becomes,\nand conversely, the smaller λ is, the weaker the tracking error constraint becomes.",
