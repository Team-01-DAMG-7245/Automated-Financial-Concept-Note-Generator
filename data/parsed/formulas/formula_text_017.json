  "original_text": "In ordinary algebra, you would divide both sides of the equation by A, and X would equal B/A.\nHowever, since matrix algebra is not commutative (A*X â‰  X*A), different processes apply. In formal\nmatrix algebra, the solution involves matrix inversion. MATLAB, however, simplifies the process by\nproviding two matrix division symbols, left and right (\\ and /). In general,",
