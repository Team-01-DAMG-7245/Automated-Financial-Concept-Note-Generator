This sets the cardinality constraints for the\nPortfolio object, where the total number of allocated assets satisfying the nonzero semi-continuous\nconstraints are between MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets. By setting\nMinNumAssets=MaxNumAssets=2, only two of the three assets are invested in the portfolio.",
