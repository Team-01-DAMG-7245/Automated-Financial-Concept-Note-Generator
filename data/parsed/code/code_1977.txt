Start=1 in runBacktest sets the starting time period to "03-Jan-2006", the first date available
in pricesTT. Given that RebalanceFrequency is set to 2, you might expect the next rebablancing
period to be "05-Jan-2006". However, the fist time the strategy rebalances is on "09-Jan-2006".
This happens because the minimum value of the lookback window is set to 4 and on "05-Jan-2006"
there are only three time periods available, so the backtest engine does not call the rebalancing
function on this time period. On the next rebalancing period, "11-Jan-2006", the data includes
seven observations which correspond to all the rows up to "11-Jan-2006". On the last rebalancing
period, "13-Jan-2006", the first input of pricesTT is not included in the data. This happens
because the maximum value of the lookback window is set to 8, which means that only the last eight
time periods are passed to the rebalancing function. Also, note that the rolling window increases in
size from rebalancing period to rebalancing period until it reaches the maximum size.
