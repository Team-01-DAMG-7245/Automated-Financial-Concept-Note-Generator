Use fitmodel to fit a logistic regression model using WOE values. fitmodel internally transforms
all the predictor variables into WOE values, using the bins found during the automatic binning
process. By default, fitmodel then fits a logistic regression model using a stepwise method. For
predictors that have missing data, there is an explicit <missing> bin with a corresponding WOE
value computed from the data. When you use fitmodel, the corresponding WOE value for the
<missing> bin is applied when the function performs the WOE transformation.
