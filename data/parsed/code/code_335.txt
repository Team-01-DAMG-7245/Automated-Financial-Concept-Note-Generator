Another important feature of convex functions is that all tangents of the function lie underneath the
function. This feature is particularly useful in problems with cardinality constraints or conditional
bounds. For more information on cardinality constraints and conditional bounds, see “Working with
'Conditional' BoundType, MinNumAssets, and MaxNumAssets Constraints Using Portfolio Objects” on
page 4-81 and setMinMaxNumAssets. The Financial Toolbox internal solvers for portfolio problems
with binary variables use an iterative method that approximates the nonlinear functions (for example,
variance) with a collection of linear functions. The linear functions used to approximate the original
function are the tangents of the function at different points. Because the tangents for convex
functions always lie underneath the function, the Financial Toolbox solvers guarantee that the
approximation does not remove any minimum from the problem.
