Alternatively, you can also use the covarianceDenoising function to estimate a covariance matrix
(denoisedCov) using denoising to reduce the noise and enhance the signal of the empirical
covariance matrix. [1 on page 4-236] The goal of denoising is to separate the eigenvalues associated
with signal from the ones associated with noise and shrink the eigenvalues associated with noise to
enhance the signal. Thus, covarianceDenoising is a reasonable tool to identify the number of
factors.
