Given a portfolio optimization problem in a PortfolioCVaR object, the estimateFrontier
function computes efficient portfolios spaced evenly according to the return proxy from the minimum
to maximum return efficient portfolios. The number of portfolios estimated is controlled by the hidden
property defaultNumPorts which is set to 10. A different value for the number of portfolios
estimated is specified as an input argument to estimateFrontier. This example shows the default
number of efficient portfolios over the entire range of the efficient frontier.
