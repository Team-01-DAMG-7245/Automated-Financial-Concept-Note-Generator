For example, most functions that require asset life as an input, and return values corresponding to
different periods over the asset life, cannot handle vectors or matrices as input arguments. These
functions include amortize, depfixdb, depgendb, and depsoyd. For example, consider a car for
which you want to compute the depreciation schedule. Use the depfixdb function to compute a
stream of declining-balance depreciation values for the asset. Set the initial value of the asset and the
lifetime of the asset. Note that in the returned vector, the asset lifetime determines the number of
rows. Now consider a collection of cars with different lifetimes. Because depfixdb cannot output a
matrix with an unequal number of rows in each column, depfixdb cannot accept a single input
vector with values for each asset in the collection.
