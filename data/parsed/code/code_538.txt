This example shows three techniques of asset diversification in a portfolio using the
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function with a Portfolio object. The purpose of asset
diversification is to balance the exposure of the portfolio to any given asset to reduce volatility over a
period of time. Given the sensitivity of the minimum variance portfolio to the estimation of the
covariance matrix, some practitioners have added diversification techniques to the portfolio selection
with the hope of minimizing risk measures other than the variance measures such as turnover,
maximum drawdown, and so on.
