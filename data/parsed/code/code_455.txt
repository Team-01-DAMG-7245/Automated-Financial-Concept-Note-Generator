The strategies that include the penalty function in the objective give weights that are between the
minimum variance portfolio weights and the weights from the respective maximum diversification
technique. In fact, for the problem with the HH penalty, choosing λHH = 0 returns the minimum
variance solution, and as λHH →∞, the solution approaches the one that maximizes HH
diversification. For the problem with the MDP penalty, choosing λMDP = 0 also returns the minimum
