PreviousCouponDate = cpndatep(Settle,Maturity) returns the previous coupon date on or
before settlement for a portfolio of bonds. This function finds the previous coupon date whether or
not the coupon structure is synchronized with the maturity date. For zero coupon bonds the previous
coupon date is the issue date, if available. However, if the issue date is not supplied, the previous
coupon date for zero coupon bonds is the previous quasi coupon date calculated as if the frequency is
semiannual.
