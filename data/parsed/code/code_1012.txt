The transprob function understands that this panel-data format indicates the dates when a new
rating is assigned to a given company. transprob assumes that such ratings remain unchanged,
unless a subsequent row explicitly indicates a rating change. For example, for company 'ABC',
transprob understands that the 'A' rating is unchanged for any date after '6-Jul-2017'
(indefinitely).
