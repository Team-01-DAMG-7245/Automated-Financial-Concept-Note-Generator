To be more concrete about the ranges of efficient portfolio returns and risks, use the
estimateFrontierLimits function to obtain portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier.
Given these portfolios, compute their moments using the estimatePortMoments function. The
following code generates a table that lists the risk and return of the initial portfolio as well as the
gross and net moments of portfolio returns for the portfolios at the endpoints of the efficient frontier:
