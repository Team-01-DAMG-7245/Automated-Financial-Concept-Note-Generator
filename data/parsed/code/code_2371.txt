Notice that GOOG has missing data (NaN), because it was not listed before Aug 2004. The
estimateAssetMoments function has a name-value pair argument 'MissingData' that indicates
with a Boolean value whether to use the missing data capabilities of Financial Toolboxâ„¢ software.
The default value for 'MissingData' is false which removes all samples with NaN values. If,
however, 'MissingData' is set to true, estimateAssetMoments uses the ECM algorithm to
estimate asset moments.
