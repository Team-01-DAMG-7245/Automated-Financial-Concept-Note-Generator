However, you can use the same stratified sampling function to stratify the terminal price of constant-
parameter geometric Brownian motion models. In fact, you can use the stratified sampling function to
stratify the terminal value of any constant-parameter model driven by Brownian motion if the model's
terminal value is a monotonic transformation of the terminal value of the Brownian motion.
