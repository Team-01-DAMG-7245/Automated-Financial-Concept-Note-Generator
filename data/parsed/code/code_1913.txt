The Brownian semistationary process (Yt in the general rough volatility model) has W as a two-sided
Brownian motion providing the fundamental noise innovations where the amplitude is modulated by a
stochastic volatility process that depends on W. This driving noise is then convolved with a
deterministic kernel function g that specifies the dependence structure of Yt. The process Yt is also
viewed as a moving average of volatility modulated Brownian noise and, when setting the volatility of
volatility = 1, the stationary Brownian moving averages are nested in this class of processes.
