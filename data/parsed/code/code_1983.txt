If user-controlled cash assets are not specified (that is, the CashAssets or DebtAssets
parameters for runBacktest are not set), then expenses are paid from the unallocated cash
account. This is the default behavior. The unallocated cash account contains the remaining
portfolio value when the backtestStrategy rebalance function returns portfolio weights that
do not sum to 1. Unallocated cash earns the RiskFreeRate (or CashBorrowRate if it goes
negative).
