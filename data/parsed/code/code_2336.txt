Note To compute upper partial moments, reverse the signs of both the input Mean and MAR (do not
reverse the signs of either Sigma or the output). This function computes expected lower partial
moments with the mean and standard deviation of normally distributed asset returns. To compute
sample lower partial moments from asset returns which have no distributional assumptions, use lpm.
