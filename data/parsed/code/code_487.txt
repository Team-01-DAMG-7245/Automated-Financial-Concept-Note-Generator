Build a risk parity portfolio within each cluster. The hrpPortfolio function in Local Functions
on page 4-300 computes the HRP portfolio by receiving a vector with the cluster assignment and
a covariance matrix Î£. Then, a risk parity portfolio is computed within each cluster by using
riskBudgetingPortfolio. The riskBudgetingPortfolio function receives a reduced
covariance matrix that only includes the information of the assets within the cluster and it
returns the weights of the assets in the cluster
