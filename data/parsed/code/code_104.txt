In addition to the challenges of working with big data, the process of evaluating complex, sometimes
black-box, objective functions is also challenging. Objective functions supervise hyperparameter
evaluation. The trading strategy evaluates hyperparameter tunings by first computing Q on a training
subsample, and then trading during an evaluation (real-time) subsample. The objective is to maximize
profit, or minimize negative cash returned, over a space of suitably constrained configurations (n,N).
This objective is a prototypical "expensive" objective function. Bayesian optimization is a type of
machine learning suited to such objective functions. One of its principal advantages is the absence of
costly derivative evaluations. To implement Bayesian optimization, use the Statistics and Machine
Learning Toolboxâ„¢ function bayesopt.
