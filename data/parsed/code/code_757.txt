Suppose that you want to add another group ratio constraint to ensure that the weights in odd-
numbered assets constitute at least 20% of the weights in nonfinancial assets your portfolio. You can
set up augmented group ratio matrices and introduce infinite bounds for unconstrained group ratio
bounds, or you can use the addGroupRatio function to build up group ratio constraints. For this
example, create another group matrix for the second group constraint:
