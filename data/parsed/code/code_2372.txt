In addition, the estimateAssetMoments function also extracts asset names or identifiers from a
timetable object when the name-value argument 'GetAssetList' set to true (its default value is

AssetList property of the Portfolio object. To show this, the formation of the Portfolio object r is
repeated with the 'GetAssetList' flag set to true.
