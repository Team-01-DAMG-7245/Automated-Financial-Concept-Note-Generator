The Sharpe ratio (Sharpe 1966 on page 4-177) is a measure of return-to-risk that plays an important
role in portfolio analysis. Specifically, a portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio is also the tangency
portfolio on the efficient frontier from the mutual fund theorem. The maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio
is located on the efficient frontier with the function estimateMaxSharpeRatio and the dataset
object is used to list the assets in this portfolio.
