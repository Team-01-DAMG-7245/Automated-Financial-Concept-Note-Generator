To do so, use the sratio function, defined in the Local Functions on page 5-139 section, to return
the negative reward-to-risk ratio for a target return. Then, pass this function to fminbnd. fminbnd
iterates through the possible return values and evaluates their associated reward-to-risk ratio.
fminbnd returns the optimal return for which the maximum reward-to-risk ratio is achieved (or that
minimizes the negative of the reward-to-risk ratio).
