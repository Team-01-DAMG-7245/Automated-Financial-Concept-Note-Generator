The estimateMaxSharpeRatio function maximizes the Sharpe ratio among portfolios on the
efficient frontier. In the case of Portfolio with a risk-free asset, there are multiple efficient portfolios
that maximize the Sharpe ratio on the capital asset line. Because of the nature of 'direct' and
'iterative' methods, the portfolio weights (pwgts) output from each of these methods might be
different, but the Sharpe ratio is the same. This example demonstrates the scenario where the pwgts
are different and the Sharpe ratio is the same.
