The set of feasible portfolios is necessarily a nonempty, closed, and bounded set. The proxy for risk is
a function that characterizes either the variability or losses associated with portfolio choices. The
proxy for return is a function that characterizes either the gross or net benefits associated with
portfolio choices. The terms “risk” and “risk proxy” and “return” and “return proxy” are
interchangeable. The fundamental insight of Markowitz (see “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5)
is that the goal of the portfolio choice problem is to seek minimum risk for a given level of return and
to seek maximum return for a given level of risk. Portfolios satisfying these criteria are efficient
portfolios and the graph of the risks and returns of these portfolios forms a curve called the efficient
frontier.
