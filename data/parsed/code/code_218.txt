This example shows how to set the moments of asset returns by using the estimateAssetMoments
function which accepts either prices or returns and estimates the mean and covariance of asset
returns. Either prices or returns are stored as matrices with samples going down the rows and assets
going across the columns. In addition, prices or returns can be stored in a table or timetable (see
“Estimating Asset Moments from Time Series Data” on page 4-49).
