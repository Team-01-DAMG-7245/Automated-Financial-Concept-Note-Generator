function pwgt = hrpPortfolio(T,Sigma)
% Function that computes a hierarchical risk parity portfolio. The
% algorithm first computes a risk parity portfolio for each cluster. Then,
% each cluster is assigned a weight based on a risk parity allocation of
% the covariance between the cluster's portfolios.
