The negative of the expected Hessian of the log-likelihood function and the Fisher information matrix
are identical if no data is missing. However, if data is missing, the Hessian, which is computed over
available samples, accounts for the loss of information due to missing data. So, the Fisher information
matrix provides standard errors that are a Cram√©r-Rao lower bound whereas the Hessian matrix
provides standard errors that may be greater if there is missing data.
