The bar chart on the top represents the probability distribution function of the data series,
TMW_CLOSE, which is the original data series. The distribution is skewed toward the left (not normally
distributed). The bar chart on the bottom is less skewed to the left. If you plot a Gaussian probability
distribution function (PDF) with similar mean and standard deviation, the distribution of the
transformed data is close to normal (Gaussian). When you examine the contents of the resulting
object Xbc, you find an identical object to the original object TMW_CLOSE but the contents are the
transformed data series.
