for stock price S(t), rate of return r(t), volatility V(t,S(t)), and Brownian motion W(t). In this example,
the rate of return is a deterministic function of time and the volatility is a function of both time and
current stock price. Both the return and volatility are defined on a discrete grid such that
intermediate values are obtained by linear interpolation. For example, such a simulation can be used
to support the pricing of thinly traded options.
