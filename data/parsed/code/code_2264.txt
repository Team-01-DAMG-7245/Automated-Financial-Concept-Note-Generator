Previous coupon date on or before settlement for portfolio of bonds, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-1
vector. If settlement is a coupon date, this function returns the settlement date. The actual coupon
date strictly on or before settlement is returned, but not exceeding the issue date, if available. Thus,
this function always returns the lesser of the actual issue date and the previous coupon payment date
with respect to the settlement date.
