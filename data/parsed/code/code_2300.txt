Info.Obj – A variable-extent column vector, with no more than MaxIterations elements, that
contain each value of the objective function at each iteration of the estimation algorithm. The last
value in this vector, Obj(end), is the terminal estimate of the objective function. If you do least
squares, the objective function is the least squares objective function.
