'NR' is treated as another rating. The transition matrix shows the estimated probability of
transitioning into and out of 'NR'. In this example, the transprob function uses the 'cohort'
algorithm, and the 'NR' rating is treated as another rating. The same behavior exists when using the
transprob function with the 'duration' algorithm.
