constraints, the solution of this problem is the equally weighted (EW) portfolio. If X had extra
constraints, the solution would be the portfolio that satisfies all the constraints and, at the same time,
keeps the weights as equal as possible. Use the function handle HHObjFun for the Herfindahl-
Hirschman (HH) index with the estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio function.
