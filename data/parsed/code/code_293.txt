This example shows how to calculate the risk and returns for a portfolio. Given any portfolio and, in
particular, efficient portfolios, the functions estimatePortReturn, estimatePortRisk, and
estimatePortMoments provide estimates for the return (or return proxy), risk (or the risk proxy),
and, in the case of mean-variance portfolio optimization, the moments of expected portfolio returns.
Each function has the same input syntax but with different combinations of outputs. Suppose that you
have this following portfolio optimization problem that gave you a collection of portfolios along the
efficient frontier in pwgt:
