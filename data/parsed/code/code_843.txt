There are reformulations of the MAD portfolio optimization problem (see Konno and Yamazaki [50] at
“Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5) that result in a linear programming problem, which can be
solved either with standard linear programming techniques or with stochastic programming solvers.
The PortfolioMAD object, however, does not reformulate the problem in such a manner. The
PortfolioMAD object computes the MAD as a nonlinear function. The convexity of the MAD, as a
function of the portfolio weights and the dull edges when the number of scenarios is large, make the
MAD portfolio optimization problem tractable, in practice, for certain nonlinear programming solvers,
such as fmincon from Optimization Toolbox. To learn more about the workflow when using
PortfolioMAD objects, see “PortfolioMAD Object Workflow” on page 6-16.
