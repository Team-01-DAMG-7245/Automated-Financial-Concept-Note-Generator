This example shows how to use the “LookbackWindow” on page 15-0
 name-value argument to set
the rolling windows of the backtesting strategies. Each time the backtest engine calls a strategy
rebalance function, a rolling window of asset price data (and possibly signal data) is passed to the
rebalance function (“rebalanceFcn” on page 15-0
). The rebalance function can then make trading
and allocation decisions based on that data. The LookbackWindow property sets the size of these
rolling windows in terms of time steps. The window determines the amount of data from the asset
price timetable that is passed to the rebalance function.
