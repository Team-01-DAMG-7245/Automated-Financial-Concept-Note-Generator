There are reformulations of the CVaR portfolio optimization problem (see [48], [49] at Rockafellar &
Uryasev) that result in a linear programming problem, which can be solved either with standard
linear programming techniques or with stochastic programming solvers. The PortfolioCVaR object,
however, does not reformulate the problem in such a manner. The PortfolioCVaR object computes
the CVaR as a nonlinear function. The convexity of the CVaR, as a function of the portfolio weights
and the dull edges when the number of scenarios is large, make the CVaR portfolio optimization
problem tractable, in practice, for certain nonlinear programming solvers, such as fmincon from
Optimization Toolbox. The problem can also be solved using a cutting-plane method (see Kelley [45]
at “Portfolio Optimization” on page A-5). For more information, see Algorithms section of
setSolver. To learn more about the workflow when using PortfolioCVaR objects, see
“PortfolioCVaR Object Workflow” on page 5-16.
