Use simByEuler to simulate NTrials sample paths of this Bates bivariate model driven by NBrowns
Brownian motion sources of risk and NJumps compound Poisson processes representing the arrivals
of important events over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. This function approximates
continuous-time stochastic processes by the Euler approach.
