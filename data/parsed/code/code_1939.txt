PortfolioValue — The current portfolio value at the time the rebalance function
(RebalanceFcn) is called, specified as a numeric scalar. This PortfolioValue is potentially
different from the "end of day" portfolio value reported by the backtestEngine at the end of the
backtest. Transaction costs and other fees are paid after the rebalance function is called, so the
PortfolioValue passed into the rebalance function by the engineData struct may be different
from the final portfolio value reported for that day after the backtest completes.
