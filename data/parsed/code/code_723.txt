Although the PortfolioCVaR object has functions to simulate multivariate normal scenarios from
either data or moments (simulateNormalScenariosByData and
simulateNormalScenariosByMoments), the usual approach is to specify scenarios directly from
your own simulation functions. These scenarios are entered directly as a matrix with a sample for all
assets across each row of the matrix and with samples for an asset down each column of the matrix.
The architecture of the CVaR portfolio optimization tools references the scenarios through a function
handle so scenarios that have been set cannot be accessed directly as a property of the
PortfolioCVaR object.
