The sde object requires additional information to determine the dimensionality of the model, because
the functions passed to the sde object are known only by their t, Xt  interface. In other words, the
sde object requires only two inputs: a drift-rate function and a diffusion-rate function, both accessible
by passing the sample time and the corresponding state vector t, Xt .
