Train the LSTM network. Use the trainNetwork (Deep Learning Toolbox) function to train the
network until the network meets a stopping criteria. This process can take several minutes depending
on the computer running the example. For more information on increasing the network training
performance, see “Scale Up Deep Learning in Parallel, on GPUs, and in the Cloud” (Deep Learning
Toolbox).
