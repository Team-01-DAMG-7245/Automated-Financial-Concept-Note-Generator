Next coupon date after the settlement date, returned as an NUMBONDS-by-1 vector of next actual
coupon dates after settlement. If settlement is a coupon date, this function never returns the

exceeding the maturity date. Thus, this function will always return the lesser of the actual maturity
date and the next coupon payment date.
