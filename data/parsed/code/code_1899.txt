Correlation between Gaussian random variates drawn to generate the bivariate Brownian motion
vector (Wiener processes), specified as numeric scalar, a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite matrix, or a
deterministic function C(t) that accepts the current time t and returns a 2-by-2 positive semidefinite
correlation matrix. If Correlation is not a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix, use nearcorr to
create a positive semidefinite matrix for a correlation matrix.
