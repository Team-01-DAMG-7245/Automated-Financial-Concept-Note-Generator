[CallEl,PutEl] = blslambda(Price,Strike,Rate,Time,Volatility) returns the elasticity
of an option. CallEl is the call option elasticity or leverage factor, and PutEl is the put option
elasticity or leverage factor. Elasticity (the leverage of an option position) measures the percent
change in an option price per 1 percent change in the underlying asset price. blslambda uses
normcdf, the normal cumulative distribution function in the Statistics and Machine Learning
Toolbox.
