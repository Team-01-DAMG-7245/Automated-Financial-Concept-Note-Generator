Both the Portfolio object and setBounds function implement scalar expansion on either the
LowerBound or UpperBound properties. If the NumAssets property is already set in the Portfolio

universe of 500 assets and you want to set common bound constraints on all assets in your universe.
Specifically, you are a long-only investor and want to hold no more than 5% of your portfolio in any
