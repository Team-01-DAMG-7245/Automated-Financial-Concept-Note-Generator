Use simByEuler to simulate NTrials sample paths of NVars correlated state variables driven by
NBrowns Brownian motion sources of risk and NJumps compound Poisson processes representing the
arrivals of important events over NPeriods consecutive observation periods. The function
simByEuler approximates a continuous-time Merton jump diffusion process by the Euler approach.
