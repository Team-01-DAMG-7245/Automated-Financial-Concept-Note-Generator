Notice that the PortfolioMAD object determines and fixes the number of assets in NumAssets and
the number of scenarios in NumScenarios based on the scenarioâ€™s matrix. You can change the
number of scenarios by calling the PortfolioMAD object with a different scenario matrix. However,
once the NumAssets property has been set in the object, you cannot enter a scenario matrix with a
different number of assets. The getScenarios function lets you recover scenarios from a
PortfolioMAD object. You can also obtain the mean and covariance of your scenarios using
estimateScenarioMoments.
