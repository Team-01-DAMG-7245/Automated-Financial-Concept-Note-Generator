In this case, the constraints allow only one optimum portfolio. Since eight portfolios were requested,
all eight portfolios are the same. Note that the solution to this portfolio problem using the
setGroups function is the same as using the setInequality function in the example “Linear
Constraint Equations” on page 3-21.
