The Portfolio object implements mean-variance portfolio optimization. Every property and function
of the Portfolio object is public, although some properties and functions are hidden. See
Portfolio for the properties and functions of the Portfolio object. The Portfolio object is a
value object where every instance of the object is a distinct version of the object. Since the
Portfolio object is also a MATLAB object, it inherits the default functions associated with MATLAB
objects.
