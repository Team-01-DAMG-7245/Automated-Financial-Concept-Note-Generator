This example shows how to work with missing data indicated by NaN values in your return or price
data. Although “Multivariate Normal Regression” on page 9-2 goes into detail about regression
with missing data, the estimateAssetMoments function has a name-value pair argument name
'MissingData' that indicates with a Boolean value whether to use the missing data capabilities of
Financial Toolbox™ software. The default value for 'MissingData' is false which removes all
samples with NaN values. If, however, 'MissingData' is set to true, estimateAssetMoments uses
the ECM algorithm to estimate asset moments. The following code illustrates how this works on price
data with missing values:
