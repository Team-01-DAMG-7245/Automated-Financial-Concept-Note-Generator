As a deterministic function of time, when Mu is called with a real-valued scalar time t as its only
input, Mu must produce an NVars-by-NVars matrix. If you specify Mu as a function of time and state,
it calculates the expected instantaneous rate of drift. This function must generate an NVars-by-1
column vector when invoked with two inputs:
