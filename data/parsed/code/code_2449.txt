To obtain efficient portfolios that have targeted portfolio returns, the estimateFrontierByReturn
function accepts one or more target portfolio returns and obtains efficient portfolios with the
specified returns. Assume you have a universe of four assets where you want to obtain efficient
portfolios with target portfolio returns of 6%, 9%, and 12%. Use estimatePortSharpeRatio to
obtain the Sharpe ratio for the collection of portfolios (pwgt).
