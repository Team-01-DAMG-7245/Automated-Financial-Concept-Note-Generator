This example shows how to use estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio to solve a portfolio
problem with a custom objective and cardinality constraints. You define the constraints for portfolio
problems using functions for the Portfolio object and then you specify the objective function as an
input to estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio. For problems with cardinality constraints or
continuous bounds, the objective function must be continuous and convex.
