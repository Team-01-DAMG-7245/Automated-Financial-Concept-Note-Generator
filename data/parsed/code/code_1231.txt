Once you have simulated sample paths, options are priced by the least squares regression method of
Longstaff & Schwartz (see Valuing American Options by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares
Approach, The Review of Financial Studies, Spring 2001). This approach uses least squares to
estimate the expected payoff of an option if it is not immediately exercised. It does so by regressing
the discounted option cash flows received in the future on the current price of the underlier
associated with all in-the-money sample paths. The continuation function is estimated by a simple
third-order polynomial, in which all cash flows and prices in the regression are normalized by the
option strike price, improving numerical stability.
