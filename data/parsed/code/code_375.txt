If the sum(AssetWeight_i) is less than 1, the extra cash is invested in a risk-free asset. If the
sum(AssetWeight_i) is larger than 1, meaning that total risky asset investment is larger than
initial available cash, the risk-free asset is shorted (borrowed) to fund the extra investment in a risky
asset. The cost associated with borrowing a risk-free asset is automatically captured in the mean-
variance optimization model for the Portfolio class. Therefore, you can use the setBudget
function directly to control the level of leverage of cash for the portfolio.
