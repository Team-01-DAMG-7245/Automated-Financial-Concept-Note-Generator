The simByEuler function partitions each time increment dt into NSteps subintervals of length dt/
NSteps, and refines the simulation by evaluating the simulated state vector at NSteps âˆ’ 1
intermediate points. Although simByEuler does not report the output state vector at these
intermediate points, the refinement improves accuracy by allowing the simulation to more closely
approximate the underlying continuous-time process.
