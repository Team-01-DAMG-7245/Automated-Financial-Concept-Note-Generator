Direct specification of the dependent random noise process used to generate the Brownian motion
vector (Wiener process) that drives the simulation, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting
of 'Z' and a function or as an (NPeriods * NSteps)-by-NBrowns-by-NTrials three-dimensional
array of dependent random variates.
