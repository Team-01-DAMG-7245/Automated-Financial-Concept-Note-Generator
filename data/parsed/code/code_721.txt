The CVaR of a portfolio is a conditional expectation. (For the definition of the CVaR function, see
“Risk Proxy” on page 5-5.) Therefore, the CVaR portfolio optimization problem is a stochastic
optimization problem. Given a sample of scenarios, the conditional expectation that defines the
sample CVaR of the portfolio can be expressed as a finite sum, a weighted average of losses. The
weights of the losses depend on their relative magnitude; for a confidence level α, only the worst (1 −
α) x 100% losses get a positive weight. As a function of the portfolio weights, the CVaR of the
portfolio is a convex function (see [48], [49] Rockafellar & Uryasev at “Portfolio Optimization” on
page A-5). It is also a nonsmooth function, but its edges are less sharp as the sample size increases.
