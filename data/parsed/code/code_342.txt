A specialized "helper" function portfolioexamples_plot makes it possible to plot all results to be
developed here. The first plot shows the distribution of individual assets according to their means and
standard deviations of returns. In addition, the equal-weight, market, and cash portfolios are plotted
on the same plot. Note that the portfolioexamples_plot function converts monthly total returns
into annualized total returns.
