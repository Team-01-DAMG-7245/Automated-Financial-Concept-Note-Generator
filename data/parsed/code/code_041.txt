Some MATLAB functions accept numeric data types but not datetime values as inputs. To apply these
functions to your date and time data, first, convert datetime values to meaningful numeric values, and
then call the function. For example, the log function accepts double inputs but not datetime
inputs. Suppose that you have a datetime array of dates spanning the course of a research study or
experiment.
