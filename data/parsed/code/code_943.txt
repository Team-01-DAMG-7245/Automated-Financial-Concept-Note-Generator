When a totals structure array is passed to transprobgrouptotals, this function groups each
structure in the array individually and preserves sparsity, if the fields in the input structures are
sparse. One way to exploit this feature is to compute confidence intervals for the investment grade
default rate and the speculative grade default rate (see also “Estimate Bootstrap Confidence
Intervals” on page 8-13).
