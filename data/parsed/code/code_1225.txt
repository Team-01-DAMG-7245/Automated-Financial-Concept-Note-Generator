The function implements proportional sampling by partitioning the unit interval into bins of equal
probability by first drawing a random number uniformly distributed in each bin. The inverse
cumulative distribution function of a standard N(0,1) Gaussian distribution then transforms these
stratified uniform draws. Finally, the resulting stratified Gaussian draws are scaled by the square root
of the terminal time to stratify the terminal value of the Brownian motion.
