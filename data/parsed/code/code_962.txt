Monetary terms, once again, may be more meaningful. Use the Basel II capital requirements formula
(see [2 on page 8-43]) to translate the default rates into a monetary measure. The Basel II formula is
convenient because it is analytic (there is no need to simulate to estimate the capital requirements),
but also because it depends only on the probabilities of default. Define the Basel II capital
requirements as a function K.
