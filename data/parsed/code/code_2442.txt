Estimate the efficient portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. The estimateMaxSharpeRatio
function maximizes the Sharpe ratio among portfolios on the efficient frontier. This example uses the
'direct' method for a Portfolio object (p) that specifies a tracking error uses nonlinear
constraints. The setSolver function is used to control the SolverType and SolverOptions. In
this case fmincon is the SolverType.
