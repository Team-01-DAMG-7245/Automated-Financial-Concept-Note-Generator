The PortfolioMAD object implements mean absolute-deviation (MAD) portfolio optimization and is
derived from the abstract class AbstractPortfolio. Every property and function of the
PortfolioMAD object is public, although some properties and functions are hidden. The
PortfolioMAD object is a value object where every instance of the object is a distinct version of the
object. Since the PortfolioMAD object is also a MATLAB object, it inherits the default functions
associated with MATLAB objects.
