In “Risk Budgeting Portfolio” on page 4-286, the example describes some advantages of risk parity or
budgeting portfolios. It shows how to use riskBudgetingPortfolio to solve long-only, fully
invested risk parity or budgeting problems. When the only constraints of the risk budgeting problem
enforce nonnegative weights that sum to 1, the risk budgeting problem is a feasibility problem. In
other words, the solution to the problem is the one that exactly matches the target risk budget and it
is unique. Therefore, there is no need for an objective function. The riskBudgetingPortfolio
function is optimized to solve this specific type of problems.
