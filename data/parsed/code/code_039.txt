Note If you specify a two-digit year, MATLAB assumes that the year lies within the 100-year period
centered on the current year. See the function datenum for specific information. MATLAB internal
date handling and calculations generate no ambiguous values. However, whenever possible, use
serial date numbers or date character vectors containing four-digit years.
