'direct' — Transform the Sharpe ratio function into a quadratic one and solve one optimization
problem directly, instead of iteratively exploring the efficient frontier. The 'direct' option either
uses the solver quadprog (for a problem with linear constraints) or fmincon (for a problem with
nonlinear constraints). For an example of using the 'direct' option, see “Estimate Efficient
Portfolio that Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio for a Portfolio Object Using Solver Options with the
Direct Method” on page 15-988 and “Estimate Efficient Portfolio that Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio
for a Portfolio Object With Tracking Error Using the Direct Method and Solver Options” on page
15-989.
