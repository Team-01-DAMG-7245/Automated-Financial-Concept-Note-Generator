You can extend the traditional minimum variance portfolio problem subject to an expected return to
include the ESG metric by setting an ESG constraint for the problem. The purpose of the ESG
constraint is to force the portfolio to achieve an ESG score greater than a certain target. Then, add a
penalty term to the objective function to guide the problem toward more or less diversified portfolios.
How diversified a portfolio is depends on your choice of the penalty parameter.
