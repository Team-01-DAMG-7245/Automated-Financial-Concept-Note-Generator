When you invoke diffusion-rate parameters with inputs, they behave like functions, giving the
impression of dynamic behavior. The parameters Alpha and Sigma accept the observation time t and
a state vector Xt, and return an array of appropriate dimension. Specifically, parameters Alpha and
Sigma evaluate the corresponding diffusion-rate component. Even if you originally specified an input
as an array, diffusion treats it as a static function of time and state, by that means guaranteeing
that all parameters are accessible by the same interface.
