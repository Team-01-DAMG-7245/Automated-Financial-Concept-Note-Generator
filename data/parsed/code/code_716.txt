If the NumAssets property is already set and you pass in too many or too few identifiers, the
PortfolioCVaR object, and the setAssetList function truncate or pad the list with numbered
default asset names that use the name specified in the hidden public property
defaultforAssetList. If the list is truncated or padded, a warning message indicates the
discrepancy. For example, assume that you have a PortfolioCVaR object with five ETFs and you

to create an asset list that pads the remaining asset identifiers with numbered 'UnknownCUSIP'
