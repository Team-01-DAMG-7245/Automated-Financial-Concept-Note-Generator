The proxy for portfolio return is a function μ: X
R on a portfolio set X ⊂Rn that characterizes the
rewards associated with portfolio choices. Usually, the proxy for portfolio return has two general
forms, gross and net portfolio returns. Both portfolio return forms separate the risk-free rate r0 so
that the portfolio x ∈X contains only risky assets.
