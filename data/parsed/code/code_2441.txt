Estimate the efficient portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. The estimateMaxSharpeRatio
function maximizes the Sharpe ratio among portfolios on the efficient frontier. This example uses the
'direct' method for a Portfolio object (p) that does not specify a tracking error and only uses
linear constraints. The setSolver function is used to control the SolverType and
SolverOptions. In this case, the SolverType is quadprog. For more information on the
'direct' method, see “Algorithms” on page 15-996.
