A final simplification of the general model is to estimate the mean and covariance of a sequence of n-
dimensional observations z1, ..., zm. In this case, the number of series is equal to the number of model
parameters with n = p and the design matrices are identity matrices with Hk = I for i = 1, ..., m so
that b is an estimate for the mean and C is an estimate of the covariance of the collection of
observations z1, ..., zm.
