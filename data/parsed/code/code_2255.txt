PreviousQuasiCouponDate = cpndatepq(Settle,Maturity) determines the previous quasi-
coupon date for a set of NUMBONDS fixed income securities. Prior quasi-coupon dates determine the
length of the standard coupon period for the fixed income security of interest, and do not necessarily
coincide with actual coupon payment dates. This function finds the previous quasi-coupon date for
bonds with a coupon structure whose first or last period is either normal, short, or long.
