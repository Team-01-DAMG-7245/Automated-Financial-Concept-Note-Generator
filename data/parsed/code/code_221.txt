Notice how either approach has the same moments. The default behavior of
estimateAssetMoments is to work with asset returns. If, instead, you have asset prices in the
variable Y, estimateAssetMoments accepts a name-value pair argument name 'DataFormat' with
a corresponding value set to 'prices' to indicate that the input to the function is in the form of
asset prices and not returns (the default value for the 'DataFormat' argument is 'returns'). The
following code compares direct assignment of moments in the Portfolio object p with estimated
moments from asset price data in Y in the Portfolio object q.
