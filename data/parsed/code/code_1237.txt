The second technique is derived by differentiating the log-likelihood function with respect to the
linear correlation matrix, assuming the degrees of freedom is a fixed constant. The resulting
expression is a non-linear equation that can be solved iteratively for the correlation matrix. This
technique approximates the profile log-likelihood for the degrees of freedom parameter for large
sample sizes. This technique is usually significantly faster than the true maximum likelihood
technique outlined above; however, you should not use it with small or moderate sample sizes as
the estimates and confidence limits may not be accurate.
