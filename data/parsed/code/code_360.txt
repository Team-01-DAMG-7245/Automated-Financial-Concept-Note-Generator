Although you could accept this result, suppose that you want to target values for portfolio risk.
Specifically, suppose that you have a conservative target risk of 10%, a moderate target risk of 15%,
and an aggressive target risk of 20% and you want to obtain portfolios that satisfy each risk target.
Use the estimateFrontierByRisk function to obtain targeted risks specified in the variable
TargetRisk. The resultant three efficient portfolios are obtained in qwgt.
