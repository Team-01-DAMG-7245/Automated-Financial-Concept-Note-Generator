The fitmodel function fits a logistic regression model to the WOE data. fitmodel internally bins
the training data, transforms it into WOE values, maps the response variable so that 'Good' is 1, and
fits a linear logistic regression model. By default, fitmodel uses a stepwise procedure to determine
which predictors should be in the model.
