The efficient frontier computation functions require information about each asset in the portfolio.
This data is entered into the function via two matrices: an expected return vector and a covariance
matrix. The expected return vector contains the average expected return for each asset in the
portfolio. The covariance matrix is a square matrix representing the interrelationships between pairs
of assets. This information can be directly specified or can be estimated from an asset return time
series with the function ewstats.
