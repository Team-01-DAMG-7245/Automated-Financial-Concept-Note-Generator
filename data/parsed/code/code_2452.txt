When working with a Portfolio object, the setMinMaxNumAssets function enables you to set up
cardinality constraints for a long-only portfolio. This sets the cardinality constraints for the
Portfolio object, where the total number of allocated assets satisfying the nonzero semi-continuous
constraints are between MinNumAssets and MaxNumAssets. By setting
MinNumAssets=MaxNumAssets=2, only two of the three assets are invested in the portfolio.
