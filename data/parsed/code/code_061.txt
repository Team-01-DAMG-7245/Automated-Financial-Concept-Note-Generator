In other words, a Financial Toolbox function first examines the FirstCouponDate input. If
FirstCouponDate is specified, coupon payment dates and quasi-coupon dates are computed with
respect to FirstCouponDate; if FirstCouponDate is unspecified, empty ([]), or NaN, then the
LastCouponDate is examined. If LastCouponDate is specified, coupon payment dates and quasi-
coupon dates are computed with respect to LastCouponDate. If both FirstCouponDate and
LastCouponDate are unspecified, empty ([]), or NaN, the Maturity (a required input argument)
serves as the synchronization date.
