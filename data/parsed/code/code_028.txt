One example of such a function is the irr function, which computes the internal rate of return of a
cash flow stream. If you input a vector of cash flows from a single cash flow stream, then irr returns
a scalar rate of return. If you input a matrix of cash flows from multiple cash flow streams, where
each matrix column represents a different stream, then irr returns a vector of internal rates of
return, where the columns correspond to the columns of the input matrix. Many other Financial
Toolbox functions work similarly.
