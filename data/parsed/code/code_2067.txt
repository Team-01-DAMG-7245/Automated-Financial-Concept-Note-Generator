The end-of-period Processes argument allows you to terminate a given trial early. At the end of each
time step, simBySolution tests the state vector Xt for an all-NaN condition. Thus, to signal an early
termination of a given trial, all elements of the state vector Xt must be NaN. This test enables a user-
defined Processes function to signal early termination of a trial, and offers significant performance
benefits in some situations (for example, pricing down-and-out barrier options).
