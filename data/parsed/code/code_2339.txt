This example shows how to use estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio to solve a portfolio
problem with a custom objective. You define the constraints for portfolio problems using functions for
the Portfolio object and then you specify the objective function as an input to
estimateCustomObjectivePortfolio. The objective function must be continuous (and preferably
smooth).
