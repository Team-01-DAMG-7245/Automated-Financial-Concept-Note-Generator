When working with a Portfolio object, the setMinMaxNumAssets function enables you to set up
the limits on the number of assets invested (as known as cardinality) constraints. This sets the total
number of allocated assets satisfying the Bound constraints that are between MinNumAssets and
MaxNumAssets. By setting MinNumAssets = MaxNumAssets = 2, only two of the three assets are
invested in the portfolio.
