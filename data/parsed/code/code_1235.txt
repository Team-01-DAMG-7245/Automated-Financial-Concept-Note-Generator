Using the daily index returns, estimate the parameters of the Gaussian and t copulas using the
function copulafit. Since a t copula becomes a Gaussian copula as the scalar degrees of freedom
parameter (DoF) becomes infinitely large, the two copulas are really of the same family, and therefore
share a linear correlation matrix as a fundamental parameter.
