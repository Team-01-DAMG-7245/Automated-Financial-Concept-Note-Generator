The drift and diffusion rates, F and G, respectively, are general functions of a real-valued scalar
sample time t and state vector Xt. Also, static (non-time-variable) coefficients are simply a special
case of the more general dynamic (time-variable) situation, just as a function can be a trivial
constant; for example, f(t,Xt) = 4. The SDE in “Equation 14-1” is useful in implementing derived
classes that impose additional structure on the drift and diffusion-rate functions.
